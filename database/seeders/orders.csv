Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.

","Here is the new text using updation method!
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.","Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).","Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\"", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

Also, I attached three samples given to us as a guide. Thanks. 

As indicated in the ICA (see ICA in the Assessment section on Blackboard), in terms of programming language, you can either use Python or R, or a mix of both applied to different problems (or case studies) addressed and related solutions implemented in your ICA. Indeed, you could decide to work on a single topic either in Python or R, or you could choose to work on a set of small problems, and in this second case you could decide to use either Python or R, or maybe Python for one solution and R for another one. You CAN\'T work in this module with a programming language not used in the lab sessions.



Regarding the choice of the topics for the ICA, in this module, we are dealing with AI, in terms of intelligent agents, reinforcement learning, search algorithms or strategies, with some notions and properties of graphs/networks (functional to better understand and examine the search algorithms), and knowledge-based systems with Net Logo, an agent (or multi-agent) programmable multi-agent modelling environment. 



Thus, in the ICA you could decide to work on one of these topics addressed during the previous weeks and in the next weeks (NOT machine learning topics, such as recommendation systems, sentiment analysis, etc., where you use datasets to make inferences, as explained in Week 3). 

To give you a more concrete idea of how to work on your ICA:

If you are choosing to work on agents programming, you could start from the workbooks of week 2 and week 3, and slightly customize the agents created, since the characterization of the environment (PEAS) or the agent are different, so you need to change the definition of a few functions, but you could use the same \""structure\"" in the problem definition.


If you are choosing to work on Reinforcement Learning, you could start from the workbooks of week 4, and also in this case slightly customize the algorithm, for example considering another problem, different from those addressed in the workbooks of Week 4, but, for example, using the same q-learning algorithm. Most likely, in your problem, there will be different rewards and policies that need to be defined. You could start from another network (see examples with graphs on pages 12-19 of the workbook in Python in Week 4) and define another rewards graph (see the code both in R and Python to create a network and measure its properties in week 8). If you\'d like to work on RL, I suggest looking at examples of notebooks available in Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/, where you will find a lot of examples of implementation of RL both in Python and R. You could take inspiration from one of them and customize it for your ICA.

If you choose to work on Search algorithms/strategies and graphs, you could start from the workbooks of weeks 6 (uninformed search), week 7 (informed search) (I\'m going to deal with search in the next two weeks), and week 8 (graphs) and, for example, you could explore the solution of a pathfinding problem, starting from a graph that you create and apply various uninformed and/or informed search algorithms, comparing them in terms of efficiency, time complexity, optimality, etc.

Finally, if you choose to work on knowledge-based systems and Net Logo, you could start from the workbooks of the next two weeks (9 and 10), start from some pre-built models available in the Models Library, and slightly change them for your ICA, or create other agents based on the same principles.

From the explanation above, let me know the topic you are going to work on, programming language(s) you will use and if you need any of the workbooks for the weeks mentioned. 

Your swift response will be appreciated. 

Thanks.

I have chosen a dataset (Global Superstore Dataset) to be used and prepared the format for the report. 
Find attached the two excel sheet for the dataset and Report format. 

Also, there is an ICA template to be filled.

Find note below regarding the dataset, the analysis can be based on the details below and you can add yours. 

The Global Superstore Dashboard offers a 360-degree picture of overall sales performance. Managers can use this Power BI dashboard to set performance targets, track KPIs, and measure results.
What this Dashboard Does
The dashboard has a single screen display and offers actionable insights into key elements. Users can view detailed analyses and information including:
•	Total sales, profit, and profit ratio
•	Sales by country
•	Sales by category and subcategory
•	Total sales by city and more

Shopping online is currently the need of the hour. Because of this COVID, it\'s not easy to walk in a store randomly and buy anything you want. I this I am trying to understand a few things like

•	Customers Analysis
1.	Profile the customers based on their frequency of purchase - calculate frequency of purchase for each customer
2.	Do the high frequent customers are contributing more revenue
3.	Are they also profitable - what is the profit margin across the buckets
4.	Which customer segment is most profitable in each year.
5.	How the customers are distributed across the countries.

•	Product Analysis

1.	Which country has top sales?
2.	Which are the top 5 profit-making product types on a yearly basis
3.	How is the product price varying with sales - Is there any increase in sales with the decrease in price at a day level
4.	What is the average delivery time across the counties - bar plot


You can reach out to me if you need any other information. 

Thanks.

All I need for you to do is to write an example semi-structured interview transcript for one participant based on their experiences of being a black women and the maternity care they received in the NHS, and whether culturally focused care can improve it.

please use the topic guide to construct your questions and the thematic analysis table of participant 1 to include the participant response.

Below  is a draft abstract so you have an idea in what the topic is all about

Abstract
Background
The recent reports from the United Kingdom’ s confidential inquiry into maternal fatalities revealed racial disparities involving black women during the perinatal period. From 2016 to 2018 black women were four times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy, birth or post-partum, whereas Asian women were two times more likely (RCM, 2019). Black women make up a sizable share of the United Kingdom most disadvantage populations, with intersecting health social determinants such as unemployment or deprivation (BMJ, 2021). 

Research question
How culturally focused care can improve black women’s experience of maternity care within the UK?

Research aims and objective
To explore the experiences of Black women had during the perinatal period, to discover the obstacles that these women faced and what they think should be done to improve their experience in maternity care in the UK.

Methodology
An interpretive phenomenology research design will be adopted because the research will seek to gain insight into the perceptions of the participant whose realities is determined by their interpretation of their world. A qualitative approach will be employed as the data and information sought will be women’s experiences.  I shall interview 8 women who identify as black and are 6 months to a year post-partum. Women will be 18 years and above and I shall use social media e.g., Facebook and Instagram to recruit them. The participants would need to speak English fluently and  sign a consent form. Semi-structured interview will be carried out via video or audio calls.  The research will ensure informed consent, confidentiality and anonymity will be put in place and all participants will need to sign a consent form before proceeding with the study. and the researcher will put aside personal opinions.

been introduced to the idea of ‘Utopia’ and
‘Dystopia’, exploring visions of possible
futures dreamed up by artists, designers,
architects and writers. Your task is to select
one of the utopias or dystopias we have
discussed and explore it in more depth, and
then present your findings in a 7-10 minute
live or pre-recorded presentation. You can
choose one of the imaginary (fictional)
utopias we have looked at, or one of the
real-world historical attempts to construct a
Utopian society (such as in the early Soviet
Union, for example).

Your presentation will introduce key
elements of this utopia/dystopia: for
example, its ideology, social and economic
structures, and the visual expression of
these ideas in the work of designers.
What makes this particular world utopian
or dystopian, and how are these values
visually expressed?
If you choose a ‘fictional world’, focus on its
visual representation found within movies,
publications, or virtual environments for
example.

If you choose a real-world utopian/
dystopian case study, you will look at the
work of architects, product or graphic
designers, for example, describing how
they attempted to use design to ‘build’ a
utopian future society.
To complete the assignment, you will need
to:

1. Choose one of the utopia/dystopia case
studies introduced in the lectures and
seminars.

2. Carry out in-depth research into your
chosen topic, using at least four sources
from the university library and other
research materials.

3. Present your findings in a carefully
scripted 7-10 minute presentation, including
slides, academic references (in MLA
format), and a bibliography.

Following some feedback, I wanted to confirm that the reflections are not a formal piece of work and your reflections. There is no word count, but consider making it valuable to you. You do not need to link this one  to any evidence base (but if you want to, then that is ok too).


Information From Me

We are to complete reflective account on the virtual placement. Some information about our VIRTUAL PLACEMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH NURSING PROGRAM 

 

Snapshot of the virtual placement 

We had physical class on Monday and Friday, and meet virtually through TEAMS on Tuesday and Thursday. 

We were divided into groups 

All groups interviewed a pretend patient suffering from PTSD through TEAMS. During that interview as a group we believe we didn’t ask enough questions as it was our first time doing such. 

We did presentations on the findings of the interview and other scenarios and case studies. 

 

We had virtual meetings on Tuesday and Thursday to discuss assignments/case study as a group 

 

We did basic skills/first aid, practicing CRP, how to use Defibrillator, Saving a choking person.

 

We had group discussion in class on different scenarios/ case studies to help our communication skill

The virtual placement helped my communications skill even I need to improve and prepared me for my work placement starting January. 

No word count so please just keep it as simple as possible and use the table provided in the attached to complete the work. Only required to use one of the reflective model in the attachment. Thanks

If you require more information let me know thanks.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q1)  Do you think the work has to be something you could make a sensible business case out of while choosing the direction for the project?
Ans: Not required. The Dissertation project you are depending on to do this work is more important. Think about making a sensible business case after you have a good idea of your dissertation document.

Q2) Q) In the \""Economic case\"" I\'m not quite sure what is meant by sensitivities? How are these different from risk? 

A) Sensitivities would be a numerical analysis where e.g. you estimated cloud storage at X GBP, and that calculation is used in the overall spreadsheet determining profitability. What if cloud storage were 10% higher? Would that have a major or minor impact on the profit? Risk analysis for our purposes here is qualitative: looking at big things that might cause trouble - e.g. a change in the law that could make a major change to how you would need to do business. (Risk analysis for a more serious business plan could include analysing the possible outcomes when considering a probability distribution for the estimated parameters used in the calculations - but this is too detailed for this work).

Q3) Q) For some aspects costs can be estimated (such as cloud systems). But for my project (logo generation through GANs) I\'d like to go over data collection and the effort required to generate and label data for training the GAN. I\'m wondering how to estimate costs for this? 

A) Look at costs on some crowdsourcing platform, e.g. Amazon Turk. Consider how many person-hours of work is involved, and the cost. Add some cost for a developer to create a simple web app that allows users to quickly annotate the images. Some research papers report on the cost of their crowdsourcing.

Q4) How are the figures in the spreadsheet generated in the \""Financial case\""? I\'m assuming they\'re forecasts? Similarly the ones for penetration. 

A) Yes, you make an educated guess. E.g. if costs of computer storage have been going down over the years you can assume the trend continues. If costs of programmers have been increasing, assume the trend continues. For revenues you can look at growth of similar companies in the same sector.
A lot of the document is based on educated guesses. Imagine you are going to pitch the idea to potential investors, and they will grill you on some details. E.g. you give figures for costs and revenues, and they will ask how did you come up with the figures, can we believe it? And you would need to explain some reasonable data it is based on.

Q5) What differentiates the cost outlined in the economic case from the ones in the financial case? 

A) There will be some commonality, but the strategic case gives approximate numbers (major costs/revenues) for a few short list options that are considered, whereas the financial case gives detailed figures for the one option that has been selected.

Q6) Do we have to show how these costs are derived in the report?

A) You won’t have space to show all – you may want to explain how some key costs are derived if you have space and you feel it’s an important point.

Q7) Is referencing allowed within the report?

A) yes

Q8) For some of the financial tables do we need to give a reference on what basis we would be estimating the costs or any other estimates we are making?

A) It is good to give a reference, if possible, but not required for everything.

Q9) For the financial part-\""Only present a summary of the results of your modelling in your final report. Showing which model works best\"". We need to present the best option we are choosing from the shortlist which gets created in strategic case or we need to have a comparison among the shortlist 

A) In the financial case you only present the best option. In the strategic case you look at alternatives.

Q10) As in the sample reports, there are no references so similarly should our report not include any references as well.

I have also included the TEMPLATE in which the report must be written AND ALSO THE \""Marker form\"". The MARKER FORM is also an important document as it gives us an idea of where can we maximize the marks. The pass mark is 50 and we need to pass this by any cost please. THIS WORK IS SORT OF LIKE A CASE STUDY THAT IS BASED ON MY DISSERTATION ALREADY DONE. So you will need my dissertation document as well, hence I\'ve included that below as well. I have ALSO INCLUDED PREVIOUS YEAR REPORTS numbered 1 to 6 that have scored maximum marks but please keep in mind that they are individual and depend upon their own dissertations, this is only to get an idea of the style of writing. Please also have a look at the FAQs below and only include include references that backs up what is written in the report.

Below is the info pasted from the University portal that my Professor gave me.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:

Q1)  Do you think the work has to be something you could make a sensible business case out of while choosing the direction for the project?
Ans: Not required. The Dissertation project you are depending on to do this work is more important. Think about making a sensible business case after you have a good idea of your dissertation document.

Q2) Q) In the \""Economic case\"" I\'m not quite sure what is meant by sensitivities? How are these different from risk? 

A) Sensitivities would be a numerical analysis where e.g. you estimated cloud storage at X GBP, and that calculation is used in the overall spreadsheet determining profitability. What if cloud storage were 10% higher? Would that have a major or minor impact on the profit? Risk analysis for our purposes here is qualitative: looking at big things that might cause trouble - e.g. a change in the law that could make a major change to how you would need to do business. (Risk analysis for a more serious business plan could include analysing the possible outcomes when considering a probability distribution for the estimated parameters used in the calculations - but this is too detailed for this work).

Q3) Q) For some aspects costs can be estimated (such as cloud systems). But for my project (logo generation through GANs) I\'d like to go over data collection and the effort required to generate and label data for training the GAN. I\'m wondering how to estimate costs for this? 

A) Look at costs on some crowdsourcing platform, e.g. Amazon Turk. Consider how many person-hours of work is involved, and the cost. Add some cost for a developer to create a simple web app that allows users to quickly annotate the images. Some research papers report on the cost of their crowdsourcing.

Q4) How are the figures in the spreadsheet generated in the \""Financial case\""? I\'m assuming they\'re forecasts? Similarly the ones for penetration. 

A) Yes, you make an educated guess. E.g. if costs of computer storage have been going down over the years you can assume the trend continues. If costs of programmers have been increasing, assume the trend continues. For revenues you can look at growth of similar companies in the same sector.
A lot of the document is based on educated guesses. Imagine you are going to pitch the idea to potential investors, and they will grill you on some details. E.g. you give figures for costs and revenues, and they will ask how did you come up with the figures, can we believe it? And you would need to explain some reasonable data it is based on.

Q5) What differentiates the cost outlined in the economic case from the ones in the financial case? 

A) There will be some commonality, but the strategic case gives approximate numbers (major costs/revenues) for a few short list options that are considered, whereas the financial case gives detailed figures for the one option that has been selected.

Q6) Do we have to show how these costs are derived in the report?

A) You won’t have space to show all – you may want to explain how some key costs are derived if you have space and you feel it’s an important point.

Q7) Is referencing allowed within the report?

A) yes

Q8) For some of the financial tables do we need to give a reference on what basis we would be estimating the costs or any other estimates we are making?

A) It is good to give a reference, if possible, but not required for everything.

Q9) For the financial part-\""Only present a summary of the results of your modelling in your final report. Showing which model works best\"". We need to present the best option we are choosing from the shortlist which gets created in strategic case or we need to have a comparison among the shortlist 

A) In the financial case you only present the best option. In the strategic case you look at alternatives.

Q10) As in the sample reports, there are no references so similarly should our report not include any references as well.

A) It is good to have some references where it backs up what you are saying.

Q11) Is there a hard limit to the page count? for ex if a topic is 2 pages in word the same content exceeds 2 pages while we conversion using latex.

A) There is not a hard limit, just a recommendation.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Detailed Instructions PDF.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Dissertation Document.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Instructions document.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Report Template.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The Marker form.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report -1.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report - 2.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report - 3.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report - 4.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report - 5.pdf\"",\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Past report - 6.pdf\"",\""\""]",22.95,16.07,305.23,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

A third party company designed a new network infrastructure for the Local area network in the branch, with an internet connection to provide a Wide Area Network connectivity to other branch.
The network infrastructure schematic diagram, shown in figure 1, illustrates the solution provided by the third party company. The company points out the following:
•	The third party company decided not to segment the network into many VLAN due to the number of users. The number of users in the branch is 40.
•	The third party company also decided not to allocate a room specifically for the server as each department will keep their server as close to the users as possible for ease of management and hence the HR server will be close to the HR users and so is the finance etc..
•	The backup services will be performed automatically on an external Hard Disk Drive positioned as close to each server as possible and will be secured in a local cabinet.
The company director expressed concern and asked you to evaluate the security and design a better security solution. According to the network design provided, the network consists of HR, Finance and users group. The servers need email and web servers added to the local File Servers located in each department. Table 1 shows the users distribution.
You have been appointed by the company director to investigate and analyse critically the third party network design and provide your assessment including any suggestion and improvement to the existing network.
Your company uses Private Range of 10.16.0.0/24. Security, Availability and scalability are paramount and hence your design and configuration must be based on these criteria.

Can I have the same writer as the last order as above and (NOT CALUM S) please… as both assignments failed with Callum S. 
can provide log in details for assignment *******

This assignment has TWO parts, which are outlined below. Due to the tasks’ format, it is NOT necessary to write in a typical essay style – just answer the tasks whilst writing academically.

Part 1 – athlete monitoring
(1000 words, 65 marks)

Complete the following tasks using EITHER a volleyball athlete OR a personal training athlete:

volleyball player (athlete) – the external load on this athlete is the twice-weekly training prescribed by the coach on court and the once-weekly match they play at the weekend
personal training participant (athlete) – the external load on this athlete is the exercises prescribed by their coach during the thrice-weekly PT sessions in the gym, and includes all aspects of the session, i.e. the warm-up, cardio, resistance training and cool down.
Task 1 (200 words, 15 marks)

In your chosen case study:

First, describe ONE measure of internal load that you could use with your selected athlete; briefly justify your measurement selection and consider how reliable and valid the data will be.
Second, choose EITHER sleep OR hydration (both are moderators of internal load that can impact on training and performance) and describe how you would measure your chosen moderator. Briefly justify your choice of measurement and consider how reliable and valid the data will be.
Task 2 (500 words, 30 marks)

Explain the impact that external load and your chosen moderator of internal load from Task 1 (sleep or hydration) can have on the athlete if they are not optimised.

Task 3 (300 words, 20 marks)

Discuss ONE strategy that can be implemented to optimise your chosen moderator of internal load (sleep or hydration) in your chosen coaching situation (i.e. with the volleyball or PT athlete).

Part 2 – biomechanical principles
(500 words, 35 marks)

When you are monitoring an athlete, you may look to measure any factors that impact their risk of injury and level of performance. With this in mind, complete the following two tasks:

Task 1 (200 words, 15 marks)

Describe ONE external force that acts upon the athlete you selected in Part 1 whilst taking part in their sport (volleyball) or fitness activity (PT).

Task 2 (300 words, 20 marks)

Explain how the external force you identified in Task 1 above can be manipulated to reduce any negative impact on training or performance for the athlete.


Task 1
Introduction
The role of the coach is to prescribe a well-designed training programme that exposes the athlete to a range of stresses so that physical, physiological and psychological adaptations can take place, to influence training and performance. However, the coach is unable to write such a training programme unless they know how the athlete is responding to the training. It is the careful management of the prescribed training and how the athlete responds that is important.

Part 1 is a series of tasks allowing you to demonstrate your understanding of the coaching process with regards to monitoring the athlete’s response to training involving external load, internal load and moderators of internal load.

Due to this task format, it is NOT necessary to write in a typical essay style – just answer the tasks whilst writing academically.

First, this task requires you to:

state ONE appropriate measure that you would use to assess the internal load on the athlete
justify your selection including a consideration of the reliability and validity of this measure.
Second, this task requires you to focus on ONE specified moderator: sleep or hydration. For your chosen moderator you should describe:

a suitable measure of assessing your chosen moderator (this can be either an objective or subjective measure) and
justify your reasons for selecting this measure, including considerations regarding the reliability and validity of the measure.
Remember that this task is asking you to focus on the measurement of the data i.e. how would you measure your chosen moderator, why have you chosen this method of measurement and how reliable and valid is it? It DOES NOT ask you to discuss the impact of the load and the moderator; this comes in Task 2.

Before you start, it is recommended you fully understand each of the key terms and know examples of each for your chosen athlete:

external load
internal load
moderator of internal load
test reliability
test validity.
As a starting point, you may wish to revisit the following module materials:

for information on external and internal loads, you may find Unit 8, Section 8.5 What is training load? and Activity 8.3 External or internal load, that is the question useful
for information on moderators, you may find Unit 10, Activity 10.1 Tutor group forum: athlete monitoring model useful.
There is also a great deal of research in this area if you want to read more. Use the OU Library Search to look for the research.

Task 2
This task is asking you to focus on the impact of the external load and also the chosen moderator from Task 1 (sleep or hydration). You must use evidence to support your claims, which could come from the module materials, associated readings and additional research. Remember all references should be correctly detailed in-text and in your reference list, as per Cite Them Right (Harvard) style.

First, you should clearly:

identify the impact if the external load is not optimised and
explain the implications for the athlete if this happens.
You should then discuss your chosen moderator (sleep or hydration) including:

providing reasons as to why it may not be optimised in the first place and
the impact this lack of optimisation may have on the athlete.
Ensure you focus on the impact of suboptimal conditions rather than discussing the solutions, as this is covered in Task 3.

As a starting point you may wish to revisit the following module materials:

for information on fatigue, you may find Unit 9, Section 9.2 A closer look at fatigue and Activity 9.1 Fatigue: overreaching and overtraining useful
for information on the impact of moderators on internal load, you may find all the sections, subsections and activities through Unit 10, Section 10.3 Other measures to consider useful.
Task 3
This task reflects what you may need to do in a coaching situation in the future: problem solve and provide solutions to optimise the impact of your chosen moderator (sleep or hydration). Ensure that you draw on how it may have been impacting when suboptimal (Task 2) and present evidence to support one strategy to help optimise the moderator.

As a starting point you may wish to revisit the following module materials:

for information on the practical application of sRPE you may find Unit 8, Section 8.6 Session rating of perceived exertion – sRPE and Activity 8.4 Practical applications of an athlete’s sRPE useful
for information on strategies to optimise moderators you may find all sections and activities through Unit 10, Section 10.3 Other measures to consider and Section 10.5 Using data in practice useful.

During the online support sessions, you are free to ask any assessment related questions. 


Your tutors will also allocate time in the last week’s workshop to support you for this assessment. 


If you require additional supports, please contact your module tutors.



Assessment reading: 


Reading list will be provided in your regular lectures on a weekly basis. 


Essay development:

You are advised to follow these steps to develop answers to your essays. 

Stage 1 – broad reading 

To answer the essay question, you will need to read widely around the topic. A few references are given above to give you a direction, but this is not an exhaustive list. You need to do your own literature search and review. 

Stage 2 – selecting relevant material

Having undertaken wide reading, you need to bring your ideas together. Try to make a list of the theories/concept/arguments you have identified and ensure that you understand them (this might mean doing some further work). What issues are interesting here – do all of the authors agree with one another? 

Stage 3 – organising the material you have identified into an argument 

This is a creative part which demonstrates that you can undertake ‘critical’ and ‘evaluative’ work. Your task is to convey that you have understood the available literature, bring in your own arguments and put them together in a meaningful and original manner (not copying other people). You need to think about the logical way of grouping different ideas and how you can best convey that.

Stage 4 – drafting your work

It is likely that you will have to draft it and edit it a number of times. The first attempt may look very rough.   

Stage 5 – polishing your work

Edit, edit, edit.  Check that your arguments are linked fluently.  Make sure your 

references are presented in the right format.  What makes your work original and interesting?


General study guidance: 

 

Cite all information used in your work which is clearly from a source. Try to ensure that all sources in your reference list are seen as citations in your work, and all names cited in the work appear in your reference list. 

 

Reference and cite your work in accordance with the APA 7th system – the University’s chosen referencing style.  For specific advice, you can talk to your Business librarians or go to the library help desk, or you can access library guidance via the following link:

APA 7th referencing: https://library.hud.ac.uk/pages/apareferencing/

 

The University has regulations relating to academic misconduct, including plagiarism. The Learning Innovation and Development Centre can advise and help you with how to avoid ‘poor scholarship’ and potential academic misconduct. You can contact them at busstudenthub@hud.ac.uk.

 

If you have any concerns about your writing, referencing, research or presentation skills, you are welcome to consult the Learning Innovation Development Centre team busstudenthub@hud.ac.uk. It is possible to arrange 1:1 consultation with a LIDC tutor once you have planned or written a section of your work, so that they can advise you on areas to develop.

Design/methodology/approach – An exploratory case study approach will be adopted. One FVL provider with three different automotive OEM customers will be used for the case study. The study will be focused on the differences in the reduction of CO2 emissions for each OEM dependent on their initiatives. The paper will use primary semi-structured interviews and observation data, and secondary documents, and it is informed by the boundary-spanning and social capital theory. 

Research limitations/implications –  FVL providers are concerned with the activities involved in the movement of vehicles from the time they leave the OEM production line until they reach the dealer or final customer. Sustainable supplier development (SSD) in this study will be defined as “any initiative taken by the buying firms to improve their supplier sustainability capabilities to meet two or more elements of the triple bottom line (TBL) of multiple stakeholders along the supply chain. An insight will be given into the key drivers for finished vehicle logistics providers, be they “economic sustainability”, “responsible consumption and production”, “industry, innovation, and infrastructure”, and “affordable and clean energy”.  

Practical implications - Knowing how OEM SSD initiatives affect FVL sustainability focus and orientation is valuable information for researchers and managers to adapt and mitigate their business logistics according to the forecasted trends. 

 Originality/value – The paper will contribute to the SSD literature by examining the Automotive OEM’s boundary-spanning role in the downstream supply chain and logistics relationship drawing theoretical and empirical conclusions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Anton, I see you substantially updated the topic to adjust it to the (post-)pandemic realities.

 

Please remember that one of the most important weaknesses of your previous versions of the thesis was that you did not carry out your OWN emirical studies. I am afraind this is also the weakness of your most recent version. No matter how sophisticated and up-to-date literature sources you quote,  you also need to make your own empirical contribution to the development of management science.

 

I recommend you develop a set of research questions:, then develop a research tool, eg a questionnaire for IDIs or CAWI, carry out your own study on a selected sample of (experts in aviation etc.), then process the results, compare them with your hypotheses, and present the research findings.

 

That is the crux of every PhD. I copied some parts of your thesis which indicate that this crucial element is (still) missing as of now. I consulted your present version with prof. Bialowos and we came to exactly the same conclusions.


 

 

4.7 Research Design
The completion of research process is considered as the research design. A research design serves as a framework, including considerations, which are being dealt with in order to lead with an appropriate methodology. This framework indicates the philosophy adopted by the researchers, as well as the appropriate research approach which is in line with the philosophy. In addition, the data collection and analysis aspects are a part of the research design. This framework can have a focus that is different from the research design of other studies; therefore, the research design is categorised into three types. Thus, a research design can be descriptive, explanatory, and exploratory as well.

A descriptive research design emphasizes reflecting on the experiences of the respondents in a study which indicates qualitative research; however, a descriptive research design can be used for quantitative research as well in some cases. In terms of qualitative research, mostly descriptive research designs include ethnographic studies where the variables are observed in their natural habitat in order to derive objective research outcomes. On the other side, the descriptive research design for quantitative research can be used to understand descriptive statistics of the variables involved in the study like demographic characteristics of the population under study.

Explanatory research design as suggested by the name, focuses on exploring the characteristics of a population or certain social phenomenon. An explanatory research design can be practiced where there is a quantitative framework being developed. An exploratory research design is used for the exploration of an issue that has already occurred when no significant amount of work was present. In terms of exploratory research design, the Covid-19 pandemic and its related issues are a good example where there was not enough knowledge available on the issues related to the phenomenon in different domains. Therefore, it can be suggested that the exploratory research design recommends further research in a particular subject area.

4.8 Population and Sampling Frame
Sample refers to a small segment of a larger population. As in most cases, the population is quite large which makes it difficult to evaluate the whole population for a particular phenomenon in terms of whether it is quantitative, or qualitative research. Therefore, a sample should be selected with great care so that it can be referred to as a representation of the population. In the case of a sample not appropriately representing the population, there is a significant chance that results of the study are not authentic (Doyle et al., 2017). A misrepresentation of the population in selecting the sample can also be devastating for generalising results of the study. In this study, as a deductive and qualitative research approach is used, the sample in this case will be that of articles and previous research on the European Airlines relevant to qualitative, as well as quantitative research.

4.8.1 Sample Size
Sample size is the number of respondents or study articles that are representatives of a larger population. When primary data is used along with a quantitative research approach, it is important that sufficient sample size is selected. For instance, for a primary quantitative research study, a sample size of less than 30 can generate results that are more skewed. Similarly, for secondary qualitative research, the researcher should put emphasis on finding a sufficient number of articles and research papers from authentic sources in order to ensure credible results and authenticity of the study. As this study is focused on exploring the development of corporations and identification of European Airlines, the secondary data, i.e. previous studies are taken from authentic sources (Doyle et al., 2017).

4.8.2 Sampling Techniques
As mentioned above, an appropriate sample is important for authenticity of the study as well as for credibility of the results. Sampling techniques allow identifying an appropriate sample size (Doyle et al., 2017). There are a number of ways in which an appropriate sample can be identified. In this context, random sampling, stratified sampling, and convenience sampling are the most common sampling techniques around.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://final.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SURVEY SCALE.docx\""]",191.4,9.57,181.83,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Please state the main AIM(s) and OBJECTIVES(s)/questions of the study or purpose of the data collection/analysis, with references and citations (where applicable).

The term Growth essentially refers tissue growth leading to significant change in body composition, the size of the body as a whole or the size of individual parts of the body (Beunen et al., 2008) so a quantitative improvement in stature, increase in size and cellular number. These changes are a result of hypertrophy, hyperplasia and accretion, which has a significant cellular process that leads to growth (Stratton and Oliver, 2013). In other hand maturation has been defined as the time and tempo (rate) at which a human body changes as develop from childhood to adulthood and this influences overall physical capabilities (Beunen et al., 2008). An example of maturity is sexual maturity which refers to a fully functional reproductive system and another one is skeletal maturity which refers to a fully solidified skeleton (Stratton and Oliver, 2013). In sport speed is said to be the rate which an object moves, speed is known to have a significant effect on sport performance in children (Riley et al., 2000). A failure to develop speed whilst a child may restrict success and limits opportunities in sport as adult, as speed has been reported to identify adults\' level of competition in sports (Pyne et al., 2005). An understanding of growth and maturation and its impact on speed will help coaches that work with young athletes, especially strength and conditioning coaches may need to be aware of how certain factors that occur during growth and maturation may be related to different training stimuli. By knowing this will allow coaches to develop their athletes with the appropriate training programmes to help fulfill training objectives throughout childhood to adulthood of the athletes.

Please provide details of the METHOD(s), study design, data to be collected/used, how data will be obtained, with rationale and information about participants, hypotheses, data analysis, where the study is to be carried out, with references and citations (where applicable) If you are undertaking an analysis and discussion of available sources/literature only, please state this.

The participants proposed for this study will be young males from mixed school children I currently work as an assistant coach. 10 participants between the ages of 11-14 years old will be recruited to participate in this study.

Procedures:
Growth and maturation
This test will be induced by using the predictive variables of (height in inches, body mass in pounds, chronological age and the average height of both parents) the participants must be taken and used to estimate the adult height (Khamis ; Roche. 1994). Once predicted adult height has been acquired, a percentage of adult height achieved at the time of observation was calculated for all participants using Kramis-Roche equation.

Speed:
A speed test will be conducted in via 10m, 20m, and 30m sprint tests with 3 repetitions.

-Data Analysis-
The results will be imported on SPSS which is a software used for statistical analysis of different data. Shapiro Wilko test will be conducted to check for normality if the data is parametric (normally distributed) a one way ANOVA test will be conducted to check the relationship between and adult height predicted and speed but if the data is non parametric (non normally distributed) a K independent samples (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA). Age-group-based comparisons of anthropometry were made with one-way between-groups ANOVA (with three level: U11, U12, U13 and U14).

So I have my name registered at this watch from Audemars Piguet since 2019, I have sent them an email as below  31/07/2022  to the head office here in Saudi asking for my watch status, few days later after my email, they contacted me saying we recevied a call from the head office telling us to check with you. That person told me to contact us in March or come to the boutique, so I visited them on Friday asking for the manager but they told me he is not here and I even asked them where is that person who called me in July (his name is; Yasser). His colleagues took my details and said I will revert back to the head office and call you on Sunday/Monday max but no one has called yet.

I called them today 12/03/2023 asking what is the updates as he told me there are still no feedback and note that people on the list we have people from 2018 & 2017
So I want to send an email from my side asking what is the status and how I know that there are a huge demand on the watch but also I need a specifc time to know when is it expected to deliver the watch also maybe they can give me priority since I am a businessman & deal with international companies 

Quote
Dear Sir/Madam,
Greetings!

I am writing you this email in regards to the watch I registered in 2019, I tried reaching out the boutique but no answer. Is there any good news?

Looking forward your positive feedback!

Paper type: Policy Brief

Write a POLICY BRIEF on the following issue:

Briefing: Decision-making in local government

On 5/5/22, Bristol City Council held a referendum that abolished the directly elected mayor system of decision-making and replaced it with a committee system of decision-making.  You have been commissioned by Bristol City Council to write a report that they will use to inform the design of the new system when it comes into being in May 2024.
Your task is to:
1)	Outline the committee system of decision-making.
2)	 Critically discuss the system’s advantages and disadvantages
3)	Advise on whether committees should be service-specific or cross-cutting, or a mix of the two; and whether there should be one or more overview and scrutiny committees.
4)	Make any other recommendations on the design of the system you see fit.

Note: Dissertations must not exceed the stated word limit. The word limit excludes title page, abstract, contents, acknowledgements, references and appendices.

The Dissertation should be typed (one side only), font size 11 or 12 (eg. Arial), and 1.5 line spaced with the left-side margin at least 2.5cm (to allow for binding). Pages must be numbered.
Take care with checking your final copy for spelling, grammatical and referencing errors. It may assist you to ask someone else to help you in the final proof reading.

and a good conclusion, please.

Please make sure to use the thematic Analysis method. I have attached all six interview transcripts. 
Present the data and the discussion about it. I have attached the methodology chapter for your reference

The most important thing is to always relate to the research questions. 

The primary goal of the study is to find out the motivational factors for students’ decision to study at international branch campuses in Qatar. In addition, this study would like to: 
1.	Determine the role of different factors in the final decision-making. 
2.	Suggest some recommendations for IBCs to attract local students. 

The research questions that will guide my investigation are:

1.	What were some of the factors that influenced students\' decision to enrol at an international branch campus?
2. What barriers or challenges are faced by students when choosing an IBC?
3. How can IBCs in Qatar improve their recruitment strategies to facilitate student choices?

--------
Once you have the headings, it might be helpful to go back to your data and highlight specific lines that can/might be used as examples in your writing. If you have used multiple different instruments to collect data (e.g. interviews and observations), you are going to want to ensure that you are using both examples within each section (if possible). This is so that you can demonstrate to more well-rounded perspective of the points you are trying to make. Once you have identified some key examples for each section, you might still have to do some further cutting/editing.

Once you have your examples firmly selected for each subsection, you want to ensure that you are including enough information. This way, the reader will understand the context and circumstances around what you are trying to ‘prove’. You must set up the examples you have chosen in a clear and coherent way.

Students often make the mistake of including quotations without any other information. It is important that you embed your quotes/examples within your own thoughts. Usually, this means writing about the example both before and after. So you might say something like, “One of the main topics that my participants highlighted was the need for more teachers in elementary schools. This was a focal point for 7 of my 12 participants, and examples of their responses included: [insert example] by participant 3 and [insert example] by participant 9. The reoccurring focus by participants on the need for more teachers demonstrates [insert critical thought here]. By embedding your examples in the context, you are essentially highlighting to the reader what you want them to remember.

Please do contact me if you have any questions.

Thank you so much

One way of identifying a place which you culturally identify with could mean where you were born, where your ancestors come from or where you have spent most of your life. 
For Example - Kat  culturally identifies with Perth (Indigenous people are Whadjuk Noongar), the North Island of New Zealand (home of the Ngāti Maru and  Ngāti Pāoa tribes) and the Métis people of Vancouver. You may come from a country where the First Nations people are still practicing traditional environmental knowledge. 

Prepare no more than 5-6 slides, including the Opening Slide and References (i.e. 3-4 slides for content)
It seems surprising, but for short duration presentations, you should have no more than 1 slide every 2 mins. 
For presentations >5mins, 1 slide every 3-5 mins is a good guide.

Time goes quickly when you\'re presenting
It seems hard to believe, but it\'s true.

Avoid too much text  on slides and remember that small fonts on images are hard to read
[Kat notes that her slides often have too much text for her liking!] 

Practice before you start recording

Everyone gets nervous... that\'s ok!

Discuss and evaluate the changes made in The Lego Group since Jorgen Vig Knudstorp took over as CEO in 2004.  Use Kotter’s 8 Step Change Management Model (Kotter, 1995) and other relevant literature/models to support your answer.

Question 2 (900 words, 20 marks)
Discuss and evaluate Jorgen Vig Knudstorp’s leadership of The Lego Group. Use Transformational Leadership Theory (Bass & Avolio 1985) as the basis for your answer.

Question 3 (900 words, 20 marks)
Using your understanding of leadership and change during the COVID19 pandemic, what recommendations would you give to The Lego Group to continue their success in the future (2022 onwards)? Support your recommendations with theory/COVID based reports, as appropriate. Please note that the recommendations cannot include something that Lego already does or has previously chosen not to do (unless this can be fully rationalized). Students need a fully justified rationale for a recommendation, which requires a deep level of background research.

It should critically review previous studies/papers on the causes of lameness in broilers. 

The layout required is as follows:

1. A title page to include:
Title of thesis
Author’s name
A statement which says ‘A dissertation submitted in part fulfilment of the MSc in Applied Poultry Science’
Year of submission
2. A contents page (a clear and chronological list of the dissertation content with page numbers)
3. A list of the tables and figures (if appropriate) with page numbers
4. Journal for proposed publication (from list of recommended journals – see Learn for more details)
5. Statement of personal contribution to the thesis
6. Acknowledgements (optional)
7. *Abstract
8. *Introduction (short – why is this review important?)
9. * Method of collecting literature (optional – but can be very useful to provide structure) 
10.*Main body of literature (don’t call it this name!) – split into sections. You may want to include some form of analysis of the data from the literature.
11.*Conclusion
12. *Implications for the field of Applied Poultry Science (500 words maximum)
13. *Criticism of the methodology (1500 words maximum)
14.*Future Research Proposal (1000 words maximum)
15. References
16. Appendices (containing relevant additional data/pictures/diagrams etc. – this is optional)

The maximum word count is 13000 words, not including references, contents pages, etc etc.

I can give guidance on which specific causes to look at to save a lot of time. The dissertation also needs a chapter on back ground. For example, this would show how the broiler industry and thus broilers themselves have changed over the past few decades (through genetic improvements, nutrition, housing, management etc). This is important as most causes of leg issues in broilers are multi factorial, so back ground is important.

TASK DESCRIPTION

Christine had recently turned 40 and her husband had arranged a surprise birthday party for her at their home. On the night of the party, Christine was very keen to show her guests the expensive gifts she had been given for her birthday, one being a designer handbag. One of Christine\'s friends, Paula had always been extremely jealous of the lavish gifts that Christine’s husband bought her and when no one was looking, she put the handbag inside her coat and took it outside. When Paula heard someone coming, she placed the handbag underneath her car with the intention of putting it into her car when the party had finished. 
Also at the party were Leon and Harriet who had been recently introduced to one another. Harriet didn\'t drink alcohol due to the fact that she was allergic to it. When Harriet had popped to the toilet, Leon spiked Harriet\'s drink with vodka. When Harriet returned and drank the drink she began suffering from hallucinations. Harriet thought that fire was engulfing the house and in an attempt to get out, she began smashing the large panes of glass in the bi-fold doors of Christine\'s kitchen. She also hit one of the other guests (Daniel) in the face, causing a broken cheek bone. Christine and her husband managed to calm Harriet down, and asked everyone to leave. 
Upon leaving, Paula picked up the designer handbag from underneath her car, placed it in the foot well and drove home. 

Advise Paula and Harriet of their potential criminal liability, along with any defences that may apply. 

In order to address this task question, you are encouraged to revise the taught sessions on the relevant topics. For each relevant offence, you must demonstrate how the actus reus and mens rea requirements have been met, along with any defence that may apply. 

Although you are not expected to refer to academic literature throughout your answer, you must ensure that you support all of your advice with case law and statute and that you reference this in accordance with the Harvard referencing system. 

Some of the cases you may wish to include within your answer are: 
Morris [1983]
Ghosh [1982]
Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) ltd [2017]
Wheatley and another [2006]

GUIDANCE FOR STUDENTS IN THE COMPLETION OF TASKS

NOTE: The guidance offered below is linked to the five generic assessment criteria overleaf.

1.	Engagement with Literature Skills
Your work must be informed and supported by scholarly material that is relevant to and focused on the task(s) set.    You should provide evidence that you have accessed an appropriate range of sources, which may be academic, governmental and industrial; these sources may include academic journal articles, textbooks, current news articles, organisational documents, and websites.  You should consider the credibility of your sources; academic journals are normally highly credible sources while websites require careful consideration/selection and should be used sparingly.   Any sources you use should be current and up-to-date, mostly published within the last five years or so, though seminal/important works in the field may be older.  You must provide evidence of your research/own reading throughout your work, using a suitable referencing system, including in-text citations in the main body of your work and a reference list at the end of your work. 

Guidance specific to this assessment: Please note, when you are referencing case law, you do not need to state where you have accessed the information as the case is a source in its own right. Instead, you need to list all case citations in full, at the end of your reference list. 


2.	Knowledge and Understanding Skills
At level 4, you should be able to demonstrate knowledge of the underlying concepts and principles associated with your area(s) of study.  Knowledge relates to the facts, information and skills you have acquired through your learning.  You demonstrate your understanding by interpreting the meaning of the facts and information (knowledge). This means that you need to select and include in your work the concepts, techniques, models, theories, etc. appropriate to the task(s) set.  You should be able to explain the theories, concepts, etc. to show your understanding.  Your mark/grade will also depend upon the extent to which you demonstrate your knowledge and understanding. 

Guidance specific to this assessment: In order to demonstrate good knowledge and understanding, you must ensure you are paraphrasing all content, rather than quoting material. Your ability to do this, shows that you understanding what the content means. 
Utilise the cases provided on the assignment brief, as inclusion of these within your answer will help ensure relevant content is being discussed. 


3.	Cognitive and Intellectual Skills
You should be able to present, evaluate and interpret qualitative and quantitative data, in order to develop lines of argument and make sound judgements in accordance with basic theories and concepts of your subject(s) of study. You should be able to evaluate the appropriateness of different approaches to solving problems related to your area(s) of study and/or work. Your work must contain evidence of logical, analytical thinking. For example, to examine and break information down into parts, make inferences, compile, compare and contrast information.  This means not just describing what! But also justifying: Why? How? When? Who? Where? At what cost? You should provide justification for your arguments and judgements using evidence that you have reflected upon the ideas of others within the subject area and that you are able to make sound judgements and arguments using data and concepts.  Where relevant, alternative solutions and recommendations may be proposed.

Guidance specific to this assessment: 


4.	Practical Skills
At level 4, you should be able to apply the basic underlying concepts and principles to evaluate and interpret these within the context of your area of study. You should be able to demonstrate how the subject-related concepts and ideas relate to real world situations and/or a particular context.  How do they work in practice?  You will deploy models, methods, techniques, and/or theories, in that context, to assess current situations, perhaps to formulate plans or solutions to solve problems, or to create artefacts.  This is likely to involve, for instance, the use of real world artefacts, examples and cases, the application of a model within an organisation and/or benchmarking one theory or organisation against others based on stated criteria.  

Guidance specific to this assessment: Case law should be used throughout this answer to support your advice. 


5.	Transferable Skills for Life and Professional Practice 
Your work must provide evidence of the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment requiring the exercise of some personal responsibility.  This includes demonstrating: that you can communicate the results of your study/work accurately and reliably, and with structured and coherent arguments; that you can initiate and complete tasks and procedures, whether individually and/or collaboratively; fluency of expression; clarity and effectiveness in presentation and organisation. Work should be coherent and well-structured in presentation and organisation.


Guidance specific to this assessment:  Please ensure you proof read your work before submitting to avoid spelling and grammatical errors.

The student(s) will actively research the competitor landscape to establish the existing key markets for super-insulating silica aerogels, whilst gaining an understanding of evolving technologies and applications. They will gain an understanding of the novel and patented technology developed by Dragonfly (DF) insulation and apply and evolve their research, problem solving and lateral thinking skills to where this may be exploited in existing markets, together with exploring where substitution for applications where DF’s technology would provide added value including in safety and performance and drive commercial growth and market share.   
The research is a market analysis to explore the potential for entry into the existing markets for aerogel insulation with a new product that is likely to be lower cost and with lower carbon intensity. The analysis will investigate potential interest and market size, by product type, by drawing on secondary data and (possibly) interviews and primary research with potential customers. If possible, it will also propose/prioritise preferred markets/products to enter with first and key messaging regarding how to position/promote the product for that/those preferred markets/products.
•	Recommendations on applications and customers where Dragonfly products would be appropriate for substitution.

•	Recommendations on emerging markets and applications where Dragonfly products would add value and support technology evolution; particularly in areas that support the drive towards NetZero.  

•	Recommendations on market sectors and applications for Dragonfly’s products and technology, to target for short, medium and long-term commercial growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,[],610.3,61.03,549.27,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

I have attached my efforts so far and the company report from ENSCO 1330 (https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11877576/filing-history).

Description of Assessment Task and Purpose:

This element of the portfolio assessment should be 2,500 words.

The task is an outline marketing plan for an organisation of your choice.  It’s called an outline marketing plan because it’s shorter than a marketing plan in real life practice!

The organisation will usually be the one you work for, but should you not be employed in an organisation that you wish to use as the basis of the assessment, please contact your OLF to discuss a suitable alternative.

 Key points:

 The marketing plan is to cover the next 12 months
The marketing plan is to cover ONE geographic market and ONE target segment
All sections need to link together logically, as if you are telling a story!
The word count includes everything in the main body of the text (including headings, tables, citations, quotes etc). It does not include your reference list. The word count should be clearly stated on the first page of the assignment. Failure to adhere with the word count is considered in the marking criteria.
 
The outline plan should include the following sections:

 Introduction to the Organisation – approx. 100 words
Keep this short as it is just to set the context. Introduce the selected organisation, who they are, brief history, size, type of business, location, etc.

Situational Analysis – approx. 500 words
This is where you explain the organisation’s current position within the marketplace. You worked on this in Weeks 1-3.

a) Present your SWOT analysis in the main body of the text (included in the word count).

b) Provide an analysis of the main points stemming from the SWOT analysis that will feed into the rest of the plan.

                
Marketing Objectives – approx. 100 words

This is where you explain what is to be achieved by the marketing activities. You may wish to draw on the organisation’s real strategic objectives to support the development of the marketing objectives.  Write them out in appropriate language and make them SMART . You worked on this in Week 3.

Marketing Strategy – approx. 750 words
What strategy will you take to achieve those objectives? Use theory to help you to justify your approach. Think about competitive strategies, segmentation, targeting and positioning. Remember to restrict your activities to the next 12 months, ONE geographic market and ONE target segment. You could use your positioning map if you write one in this section. You worked on this in Week 4.

Tactics – approx. 750 words
What tactics will you use to follow the chosen strategy and help you to achieve the objectives? Again, use theory to support the justification of the approach. This is where you will set out a plan for the marketing mix – product, price, place, and promotion, then people, physical evidence and process for the service Ps. Try to keep it integrated so the choices make sense – e.g. a high end brand would have a premium price and provide a luxury shopping experience. You worked on this in Weeks 5-6.

Action – approx. 100 words
How will you make this happen? You could include a timeline, an illustration of the breakdown of tasks, allocation of human resources, etc. A budget is not necessary for this assignment as it would be very difficult to estimate costs of promotions, etc. You worked on this in Week 7.

Control – approx. 200 words
How will you measure and control performance? This is where consideration of risks, market scanning and performance metrics will be helpful. You worked on this in Week 7.

Reference List – Harvard Referencing must be used.

Appendix
You may use appendices to place the analysis you did for your situational analysis (audit) e.g. PESTEL, competitor analysis, marketing mix analysis, product and stakeholder analysis, etc. and for other data, risk assessments, large tables etc. The appendix should not be used to circumvent the word count and should be used appropriately.  Appendices do not form part of the work count but should be a maximum of 5 pages.  No marks are allocated to the appendices and you should draw upon the content in the main report.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1   Background of the study
 

Urbanization is undergoing its largest wave in history (UNFPA, 2016; Wang, 2018).

According to United Nations, globally today, 55% of the population lives in urban areas (United Nations, 2018; Roser & Ritchie, 2018), and that percentage is expected to rise to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2018; CNBC, 2018; WHO, 2021). In 2021, the United Kingdom had an urbanization rate of 84.15 percent (Government Office for Science, 2021; Statista, 2023).

With the continuous growth of urbanization worldwide, the adverse effect of urban environment on mental health continued to grow (Srivastava, 2009; Pelgrims et al, 2021).

Thus, researchers and policymakers are focusing more on potential benefits of incorporating green spaces into urban landscapes (Jabbar, et al., 2021; Wolch, et al., 2014).

For at least last two decades, mounting evidences in many studies has demonstrated the positive correlation within exposure of green space and improved wellbeing of physical health and mental health (Coventry, et al., 2019; Wolch, et al., 2014; Feda, et al., 2014) (will be added more reference)

According to Coldwell and Evans (2018), Green spaces like gardens, parks and urban forests can offer respite from concrete world, providing space for relaxation(will be added more reference), social interaction and physical activity(will be added more reference). Such spaces have been shown to reduce stress(will be added more reference), alleviate symptoms of depression(will be added more reference) and anxiety(will be added more reference), while enhancing cognitive functions(will be added more reference), promoting overall psychological wellbeing(will be added more reference). Besides, mechanisms underlying the relationship within urban green space and mental health have been explored extensively (Bertram and Rehdanz 2015). Understanding the role of urban space in improving mental health has become important for urban planners, policy makers and public health practitioners(will be added more reference).

• Demonstrate an in-depth understanding of the application of economic theories to health, and healthcare delivery and organisation
• Demonstrate an in-depth understanding of healthcare markets and market failure
• Examine different healthcare financing models
• Show a critical understanding of provider reimbursement mechanisms and incentives
• Critically explore and communicate complex economic theories
After choosing your country (and perhaps healthcare provider), research their healthcare delivery and health financing systems and be sure to appropriately describe the healthcare reimbursement mechanism employed. You should also link this to the economic theory we have encountered in the module whilst providing critical analysis. You may draw on academic literature, policy briefings and governmental publications to help substantiate arguments as well as statements of fact.
All assessments in this course aim to enable you to gain experience in different methods of communicating information. In this instance, you will work on a short, written report of your case study. In all assessments, we aim to assess you against how well you have met the learning outcomes. We will also give you marks for using the method of presentation well.
Assessment Overview
For this assessment, you are required to perform a case study considering the healthcare reimbursement mechanisms employed in a country of your choosing.
 
Data sources - You can use one or more of the following sources to construct your case study: literature review, existing secondary data and datasets, government reports and policy briefs, government and agency (e.g. WHO, World Bank) websites, etc.
Type of analysis - a desk-based critical analysis that requires you to compare and contrast the chosen reimbursement mechanism in the country with potential alternatives (you might want to focus on one particular type of healthcare provider e.g. General Practitioners, hospitals, and give specific examples of other country’s systems or alternatives employed in other settings).
You should reflect on incentives (on healthcare providers), efficiency (maximising health outcomes and minimising costs) and quality of care implications, whilst incorporating any other relevant economic theory. You should include critical consideration on how the chosen reimbursement mechanism might affect progress towards UHC.
Submission:
Your final submission is a written report of up to 2,500 words:
i. The report must include the following components based on your case study and analysis:
• Introduction – introduce your case study and establish how the it will
help us understand efficiency and quality of healthcare provision (guide:
~200 words)
• Background – provide a succinct summary of the reimbursement
mechanism in the country you have chosen and the context of existing provision of healthcare. Include key aspects that you may want to use in your case study analysis in the next section (guide: ~600 words)
• Case study analysis – this should be a critical analysis, presenting pros and cons of the model from efficiency and quality of care perspectives and other possible alternatives. You must back up your analysis with evidence (guide: ~1000 words)
• Discussion – succinctly discuss the issues, by comparing and contrasting with evidence, and present any limitations of your analysis (guide: ~500 words)
• Conclusions – succinctly present in a few points what can be concluded based on your analysis (guide: 200 words)
• References - use consistently and as per the referencing guidance
ii. You may choose to use subheadings in your “Case study analysis” section relating to the country, healthcare reimbursement mechanism alternatives and theory including incentives, efficiency, quality of care and universal healthcare coverage considerations
iii. Use appropriate academic referencing, using Harvard referencing style
iv. You may choose to present tables or figures to support your analysis - ensure they are
legible and contribute to your analysis. Although tables and figures do not count towards 2500-word limit, only use tables and figures if they are essential to support your case study. Redundant data presented in tables and figures are not welcome.
v. You should make good use of the word length to produce a thorough case study",,,,,,,,,,,,[],22.95,10.33,196.22,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Evidence based writing and the use of references (EXAMPLE SENT BY SUPERVISOR)  

In the mid-20th century, the increased consumption of aspirin, alcohol, and cigarettes due to stress was noted in persons with a history of chronic gastric ulcers (Alp et al., 1970). It has also been reported that stress and other psychological issues influences PUD associated with H. pylori infection as well as those unrelated to either H. pylori or the use of NSAIDs (Levenstein et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017). But it may be controversial to state that peptic ulcers are stress-induced as conversely, a study done by Lee at al. (2015) seems to reject the notion that gastric ulcers are caused by stress. ( This write up is about 100 words and four references was used).

Message from my Supervisor to me.

Firstly, your work lacks criticality as it is too descriptive without sufficient evidence. Remove numbering in the interventions and discuss its impact on readmission rate. It is not about listing interventions and explaining the meaning of each, rather it is about positive or negative impacts on readmissions, what are the arguments for and against such interventions in literature. 

Secondly, repetitive use of certain references is unacceptable for writing in band 7.  

Thirdly, if you are talking about readmission, it would be useful to talk about what the readmission rates are in the UK. For instance, \'\'since 2012 the readmission rate has been increasing, decreasing or at the same rate till date\'\'. This will strengthen your background. 
From what you mentioned, you talked about interventions that have insignificant impact on readmission. when you look at the interventions that are put in place and you know what those readmission rates are, then you can say for example, in the past ten years or so years ago, there has been no impact or there has been impact. This is really a good thing to critique. This is a narrative review, so everything depends on what evidence available out there is telling you. 

When you talk about interventions, you could argue that despite those interventions, it has no significant impact on readmission rate. For example, you mentioned medication adherence as one of your interventions, but you found out they have no impact on readmission rate when you did your findings from literature. That is really an interesting thing to discuss and in recommending why that is so or other things need to be added in or taken away. Because you are writing in band 7, you must show synthesis. (Synthesis is incorporating support from several sources of differing views). 
So, once you have done your search for example, you get 8 papers on medication adherence, 7 from community-based support, then you discuss each, highlight the positive and negative aspects in keeping people out of hospitals and show synthesis. 
Lastly, remove interventions from your chapter one and take it chapter four and do a critical discussion about the interventions. Do not forget to write about the gaps in the literature and scope for further research because that is the purpose of a narrative review.  Do not forget your search strategy in methodology. You may find it useful to do a table of the articles you retrieve.  

I wish you good luck. 

 

Dear Writer,  

Please ensure you are critique in your writing, and everything must be evidence based. My supervisor is very meticulous, and I am the only person she is supervising currently so she will go through everything. Please avoid plagiarism. I will appreciate the use of current material; you can used published materials from 2014-till date. Please read her messages and ensure every aspect she addressed are included when writing. I would love community-based intervention as one of the interventions to be mentioned in my work with any other two you find out from literature. Discussion should be about 3200 words.

Evidence based writing and the use of references (EXAMPLE SENT BY SUPERVISOR)  

In the mid-20th century, the increased consumption of aspirin, alcohol, and cigarettes due to stress was noted in persons with a history of chronic gastric ulcers (Alp et al., 1970). It has also been reported that stress and other psychological issues influences PUD associated with H. pylori infection as well as those unrelated to either H. pylori or the use of NSAIDs (Levenstein et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2017). But it may be controversial to state that peptic ulcers are stress-induced as conversely, a study done by Lee at al. (2015) seems to reject the notion that gastric ulcers are caused by stress. ( This write up is about 100 words and four references was used).

Message from my Supervisor to me.

Firstly, your work lacks criticality as it is too descriptive without sufficient evidence. Remove numbering in the interventions and discuss its impact on readmission rate. It is not about listing interventions and explaining the meaning of each, rather it is about positive or negative impacts on readmissions, what are the arguments for and against such interventions in literature. 

Secondly, repetitive use of certain references is unacceptable for writing in band 7.  

Thirdly, if you are talking about readmission, it would be useful to talk about what the readmission rates are in the UK. For instance, \'\'since 2012 the readmission rate has been increasing, decreasing or at the same rate till date\'\'. This will strengthen your background. 
From what you mentioned, you talked about interventions that have insignificant impact on readmission. when you look at the interventions that are put in place and you know what those readmission rates are, then you can say for example, in the past ten years or so years ago, there has been no impact or there has been impact. This is really a good thing to critique. This is a narrative review, so everything depends on what evidence available out there is telling you.

348,DM-000348,Maha Ahmed,ma77algh@gmail.com,,7577760549,PhD,Public Health,,Are explanatory eye movement preserved during gait initiation in the absence of visual information in young healthy adult?,Proposal,1250,5,Harvard,1,4,"This study aims to analyse the preservation of exploratory eye movements during gait beginning in young healthy adults. The research aimed to investigate the frequency and features of experimental eye movements at the initiation of steps and to explore potential changes in these patterns when participants close their eyes. 

The primary research question is:
Are explanatory eye movements preserved during gait initiation in the absence of visual information in young healthy adults?
 So here we need to clarify why this point of research focus is important and how this will make us understand and help unhealthy people with neurology disease for example Parkinson\'s disease. 

The second research question will be:
Is there a robust temporal link between eye movement and anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) in young healthy adults? 
Here at this point, we need to know why studying the link between eye movement and APA is important to be understood and how this understanding will guide us to understand old people and people with neurology disease for example Parkinson\'s disease. 

The measuring outcome of the study that we need to test in the protocol are:
1: time of delay to start walking
2: number of eye movement
3; number of fixations
4: duration of fixation
5: APA (anticipatory postural adjustment) 


The protocol:

In this study, we will do two tasks as follows:

The first task of 16 trails per each will be a task of three roots of walking (walk straight forward, walk to right bath, walk to left bath) with a target marker set on the floor for each path that shows participants where they should put their feet when they walk. the participants will be asked to stand nice and still on a  computer-controlled motion platform then they will be asked to do the task with their eyes open first then the participant will be asked to do the task again but with their eyes closed. So, at this phase we will close off the vision, we will rearrange the targets, and say to the participant you will walk to the selected bath, for example, you will walk on the right central left bath, in a second we go to left the visor and you could see the room again, you will be able to see the room for 3 seconds before we put the visor down again at this time we are going to tap the side of the glasses, that is your signal to start walking on your own time, no rash but once you feel the tap of the glasses please starting and do the task and stepping on those target on your own time when we tap the glasses you will or may not get a vision of the room back, either way, please get on the way and do the task. To measure eye movement, we will use the eye tracker. 

The second task will be a free activity task,  so the participant will be asked to walk in the room freely and given an order to move the object or change place of another, we aimed to make the participants look at another target rather than a place they know, and the time still be the same and repeat the task. 
The APA in this task will be measured by using the feet insole to know from their load their APA changes accordingly. To measure eye movement, we will use the eye tracker. 

We need also to draw protocol steps on a visual map.

Part 1

1. Introduction and background (1000words)

Under this session, student will review the current practice and develop the chosen  issue in a wider perspective including the countrywide gravity of the issue, cost to NHS etc. Relevant policies and protocols will be in discussion. The introduction and background needs to provide a reason and motivation for why the literature review was completed and  what is the problem which needs to be addressed.


2. Critical literature review (2500words)

     A.  Search strategy

This will include,

The relevant databases searched.

The keywords used. Include if there are any frameworks used such as SPIDER/PICO for developing the question, keywords.

Discuss inclusion and exclusion criteria used to filter the final selected articles.Students should use a table or prisma diagram in the appendix to demonstrate the filtration done using inclusion and exclusion.

Discuss if any critical appraisal framework used such as CASP Tool to quality check the selected articles.

   B. Aim and objectives

Student needs to develop the aim and objectives relevant to the literature review carried out. This is in relation to the research problem identified which is also linked to the service improvement proposal.

  C. Discussion of the themes 

 The chosen articles will be quality assessed using appropriate critical appraisal tools to ensure reliability and validity. Minimum 5 primary research articles mostly from UK must be critically appraised and discussed. The emerging and relevant themes will be discussed from the chosen articles to answer the aim and objectives of the literature review. Data extraction and synthesis is made at this point by comparing and contrasting the findings of the chosen articles and also analysing them with the relevant national and local policies and guidelines. The findings through the literature review will include possible identification of the research gap(optional) and identification of the need for a service improvement proposal.Part2 

Service improvement proposal including the conclusion (2500words)

Here student will identify an area of their professional practice where change might improve that practice and the experience for users, clients or patients. Student will then propose for a service improvement plan underlying various aspects of how to  successfully implement this idea into practice. The eight stage NHS change model needs to be discussed and applied for the implementation plan. Various barriers for the successful implementation of a project such as resistance to change, staffing issues, need for training and development, other resource constraints such as finance needs to be included in the discussion. Appropriate leadership such as transformational leadership needs to be included. Student needs to include a business case for the proposal in the work. Students are reminded that appropriate development of your service improvement idea using the NHS eight stage change model will sufficiently meet with the assessment learning outcome. It is not necessary to use all eight stages if it is not relevant. However, the reason for not using must be justified. The template used must be presented in the appendix.

Embedding the eight stage NHS change model in your service improvement proposal will include the following key elements in the essay structure under Part two

Give a summary of the service improvement idea in your chosen area of practice.

Discuss the common goal you are trying to achieve. How the service improvement idea contributes to the organisation values and benefits to the stake holders. A cost benefit analysis needs to be included with the support of a business case. Consider all relevant resources needed to implement the change through the business case including the cost elements. The business case to be added in the appendix embedded with an action plan however the key points (the cost benefit analysis) need to be discussed in the main body.

Recognise and explore the challenges with implementing your specific proposed change – utilise other literature and evidence to deepen this discussion. This is about the resistance to change. Identify potential ways to overcome challenges and barriers to your proposed change.

Appropriate communication and Leadership strategies needed for the successful implementation of your proposed change.

Discuss the importance of multi-disciplinary working for successful implementation by identifying the role of each member in the team for the successful implementation. This could also be reflected in the action plan with details of the expected contribution of each member of the team at various stages of the proposed project implementation.

 Consider the service user – how are they involved in your proposed change? How will they benefit?

Consider how you will know that the change has taken successfully? Discuss audits for at various stages to measure success.

Identify recommendations for future practice based on your findings and ideas.

Conclusion

Draw the KEY points from each section of your essay together. Demonstrate the value of evidence-based practice, the issues around change implementation and what the role of nurses is in this aspect of care delivery. You could identify the essential role of the nurse in delivering safe and responsive care that meets needs and how this is a requirement for a developing professional. No references or new evidence in this section.

Recommended appendices

Appendix 1: Search strategy - this should be an expansion of the information included in the main body of text which describes how you found the research used in the critical analysis of your literature review.  This should demonstrate how you refined the number of hits from your initial database search (using exclusion/inclusion criteria) to a more manageable number and from these how you decided upon the work included in your literature review.  you may describe this in the form of a simple search table with filters or a Prisma diagram or other format. 

Appendix 2: Business case - When submitting a business case in practice you would be asked initially to create a succinct summary of the key points and your plan of action to the funding body to help sell your idea.  While you will discuss your business case in detail in the main body of the assignment but may find it useful to include an outline of the plan in the appendix.  You may wish to use the template which can be downloaded here or another format but it must give a clear summary of all aspects of the service improvement plan. The business case template given under is integrated with an action plan (with an added column schedule) so that students doesn\'t need to use a separate action plan in the appendix.

 The business case with action plan must be presented in appendix.

TOPIC: Should unhealthy foods be taxed: why and why not?
Purpose of the assessment
This is an opportunity for you to research, explore and analyse a medical ethics dilemma in depth.
Although this is an assessment you should find a topic you are interested in so that you can  enjoy researching and discussing with friends and family. 

Guidance
Aim to present arguments which support, and arguments which dispute, an ethical position, reaching a conclusion based on your critical analysis of the relevant issues. You will need to build arguments using the theoretical approaches and principles we have discussed on the course. You should therefore seek to apply the four principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, deontology, justice) and three normative theories (deontology, consequentialism, virtue) where you think they apply, both to your ‘for’ and ‘against’ positions.
When writing your essay think about which of the four principles /three theories are  most appropriate to the discussion, you do not need to mention every principle/theory if it is not relevant, this will depend on your topic. For example, if you are writing about a consent issue principles of autonomy and beneficence will (usually) be most pertinent and you can go on to discuss these two principles ‘through the lens of’ each of the three theories. Again, you may find that one theory is more pertinent/useful than another, and they may apply to both your ‘for’ and ‘against’ argument.
You do not need to define the principles/theories in your essay, you can take it for granted that the marker will be familiar with the terms.
Consequentialism tends to be straightforward, a balance of harms and benefits, but think if it is  just outcomes for the patient that should be discussed, are there other outcomes (for other people?) to be considered? Deontology is a little trickier, think about universal rules, duties (including professional duties), and respect for the person (thus linking with autonomy). Virtue is also a little tricky to bring in to an essay, think ‘what would a good doctor/person/parent do’ and then mention the virtues that might drive the character of that doctor/person/parent  (such as compassion, empathy, courage, honesty).
The principle of justice, which includes access to care, distributive justice, resource allocation and priority setting will be discussed in the lectures during Semester 2. The cost of treatment/allocation of resources applies to most dilemmas and you should consider how this applies to your discussion.
You should also acknowledge the relevant law(s) and professional guidance where appropriate. You can assume that the markers will be familiar with law/guidance but here you should refer to the chosen law/guidance, the date and source (e.g GMC 2012). You may quote from the law/guidance to support your argument.
There is no need (and no marks given) for a detailed description of the medical issues which may be involved, focus on the ethics of the matter ‘what should be done?’ Therefore you only need a very brief outline of the medical issues/procedures, the markers will be familiar with the subject and you only need to expand on description where it is directly relevant to your ‘what should be done’ discussion.
The essay structure of introduction - for and against discussion – conclusion is preferred.  Ethics essays are not a ‘whodunnit’ where the outcome is revealed at the end, you can state the position you will be arguing for in the introduction.
Keep your introduction and conclusion brief, be careful not to repeat points, be careful not to repeat points and remove words which do not add to the meaning. Be careful not to repeat points. Be brutal with your editing, if you can remove a word or words, and the sentence means the same, take those words out. Be careful not to repeat points.
For example:
In answering this question, I am going to apply the main points of deontological and virtue theory to the dilemma and, considering all this through a number of arguments, will basically end up with my conclusion that 7UP is actually lemonade. (39 Words)
Applying deontological and virtue theory, I will conclude 7Up is lemonade. (11 words)
So that is 28 words saved which could be used for another mark-gaining argument.

TOPIC: Should unhealthy foods be taxed: why and why not?
Purpose of the assessment
This is an opportunity for you to research, explore and analyse a medical ethics dilemma in depth.
Although this is an assessment you should find a topic you are interested in so that you can  enjoy researching and discussing with friends and family. 

Guidance
Aim to present arguments which support, and arguments which dispute, an ethical position, reaching a conclusion based on your critical analysis of the relevant issues. You will need to build arguments using the theoretical approaches and principles we have discussed on the course.

1.	    Introduction:

In recent years, the construction industry has seen a significant shift towards gender diversity in project management. Historically, construction has been considered a male-dominated field, with women often facing barriers and stereotypes that prevent them from advancing in their careers. However, over the last decade, more women have broken through these barriers to make their mark in construction project management. The evolution of women in construction project management is an important topic for discussion, as it highlights the progress made towards achieving gender diversity and equality in the industry. 

This paper will explore how women have broken barriers and stereotypes to become leaders in construction project management. It will also examine the impact of gender diversity on the construction industry. In addition, this paper aims to investigate the experiences, challenges, and opportunities for women in construction project management in the UK. By examining the barriers faced by women and identifying strategies to promote gender diversity and inclusion, this research seeks to contribute to the advancement of women\'s representation and participation in this field. The study aims to provide valuable insights for construction companies, industry organisations, and policymakers to drive positive change in the sector
1.1.	Background and context of the study

The construction industry in the UK plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth, infrastructure development, and job creation (Smith, 2020). However, it has long been characterised by a significant gender disparity, with women being underrepresented in various roles, particularly in construction project management (Johnson & Brown, 2018). This section provides an overview of the background and context that informs the need for this research.
1.2.	Research problem and significance

2.	Literature Review

2.1 Overview of the construction industry in the UK

The literature review provides a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of the existing research and scholarly works related to women in construction project management in the UK. It examines key themes, theories, and empirical studies that shed light on the representation, experiences, and challenges faced by women in this field.

Previous studies have highlighted the persistent gender imbalance in the construction industry, particularly in project management roles (Brown et al., 2019). These emphasize the underrepresentation of women in senior positions within the construction sector. The studies underscore the need for a closer examination of the factors contributing to this gender disparity and the potential strategies for promoting gender diversity.

The literature also highlights the various barriers and challenges faced by women in construction project management. Gender bias and stereotypes have been identified as key obstacles, affecting women\'s career progression and access to leadership roles (Martin et al., 2017; Taylor & Turner, 2019). There are studies that emphasise the importance of organisational culture, work-life balance, and mentoring programs in supporting women\'s career advancement in construction project management.

Furthermore, the literature recognises the significance of gender diversity and its impact on organisational performance and innovation. Research by Smith and Johnson (2016) and Brown (2019) suggests that diverse project teams, including gender diversity, can lead to improved decision-making, increased creativity, and enhanced project outcomes.

2.2.	Gender diversity in the construction sector

The construction industry in the UK plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth, infrastructure development, and job creation (Smith, 2020). However, it has long been characterised by a significant gender disparity, with women being underrepresented in various roles, particularly in construction project management (Johnson & Brown, 2018). This section provides an overview of the background and context that informs the need for this research.



2.2.1 Gender Imbalance in the Construction Industry

The construction industry has historically been male dominated, with women facing substantial barriers to entry and advancement. Statistics indicate that women represent only a small fraction of the construction workforce, and their representation diminishes further in project management positions (Office for National Statistics, 2021). This gender imbalance not only limits opportunities for women but also hampers diversity, innovation, and overall organisational performance within the industry (Wilson et al., 2017).

2.2.2 Gendered Challenges in Construction Project Management

Women in construction project management face unique challenges that stem from systemic biases, stereotypes, and cultural norms (Brown & Anderson, 2020). These challenges encompass both organisational and societal factors. 

2.2.3 Shifting Paradigms: The Importance of Gender Diversity

There is a growing recognition of the importance of gender diversity and inclusion in all sectors, including construction. Research has highlighted the positive impact of gender diversity on organisational performance, innovation, problem-solving, and decision-making processes (Anderson et al., 2022). Embracing gender diversity in construction project management not only promotes fairness and equality but also fosters a more dynamic and resilient industry (Jones & Wilson, 2019).

2.2.4 Significance of the Research

This research seeks to address the significant gender imbalance in construction project management in the UK. By exploring the experiences, challenges, and opportunities for women in this field, the study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the barriers faced by women and to identify strategies that can enhance gender diversity and inclusion. 
2.3 Theoretical Framework

The theoretical framework provides a conceptual basis for understanding and analysing the research topic. It guides the selection of concepts, theories, and models that are relevant to the study and helps to establish a theoretical lens through which the research questions will be explored. In the context of this dissertation, the following theoretical perspectives may be employed:

2.3.1 Social Role Theory

Social role theory, developed by Eagly and Wood (1999), posits that gender differences and inequalities are shaped by social roles and expectations. According to this theory, the prevailing gender norms and stereotypes influence the allocation of roles and responsibilities within society, including the construction industry. 

2.3.2 Glass Ceiling Theory

The glass ceiling theory, proposed by Morrison, White, and Van Velsor (1987), refers to the invisible barriers that limit women\'s advancement into top leadership positions. This theory will be employed to examine the barriers and challenges faced by women in reaching senior project management roles within the construction industry.

2.3.3 Intersectionality Theory

Intersectionality theory, developed by Crenshaw (1989), recognises that gender intersects with other social identities, such as race, ethnicity, and class, shaping individuals\' experiences and opportunities. This theory will be employed to explore the unique challenges and experiences of women from diverse backgrounds in construction project management. 

2.3.4 Organisational Culture and Bias Theories

Organisational culture and bias theories examine the influence of organisational practices, norms, and biases on gender diversity.

2.4.	Theoretical frameworks and models relevant to the study

2.4.1   Glass Ceiling Theory

The Glass Ceiling Theory, developed by Morrison et al. (1987), explores the invisible barriers that prevent women from advancing to higher levels of management within organisations. This theory is applicable to the study as it helps to understand the challenges and limitations faced by women in reaching leadership positions in construction project management.

2.4.2 Social Role Theory

Social Role Theory, proposed by Eagly (1987), suggests that societal expectations and norms influence the roles and behavior of men and women in different domains. This theory is relevant to the study as it can shed light on how gender roles and stereotypes impact the representation and experiences of women in construction project management.

2.4.3 Transformational Leadership Theory

Transformational Leadership Theory, introduced by Bass (1985), focuses on the positive impact of leadership behaviors on followers\' motivation, satisfaction, and performance. This theory is applicable to the study as it can provide insights into the leadership styles and behaviors that contribute to creating an inclusive and supportive work environment for women in construction project management.

2.4.4 Social Identity Theory

Social Identity Theory, proposed by Tajfel and Turner (1979), explores how individuals\' self-concept and group memberships shape their behavior and attitudes. This theory can be relevant to the study as it helps to understand the social identity processes that influence the experiences, identity, and sense of belonging of women in construction project management.

2.4.5 Diversity and Inclusion Models

Various models and frameworks have been developed to guide organisations in promoting diversity and inclusion. Examples include the Inclusive Workplace Model by Nishii (2013). The models can provide a framework for assessing the current state of gender diversity in construction project management and identifying strategies for improvement.

3.	Methodology
3.1 Research Design

The research design outlines the overall approach and methodology that will be employed to address the research questions and achieve the objectives of the study. This section describes the research strategy, data collection methods, and data analysis techniques that will be utilised.

3.1.1 Research Strategy

This study will adopt a mixed methods research approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative methods. The use of mixed methods allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the research topic, as it enables the integration of numerical data and statistical analysis with qualitative insights and perspectives (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2018). 

3.1.2 Quantitative & Qualitative Data Collection

To address the research objective, quantitative data methods such as a survey questionnaire administered to construction project management professionals in the UK, will be utilised. The survey will be designed to gather information on participants\' demographics, job positions, years of experience, and perceptions of gender diversity within the industry. The survey data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and inferential analysis to examine patterns and trends in the representation of women in construction project management roles.

Qualitative methods such as interviews of the Project management community may be utilised to gather data to further explore the patterns and trends in this study.

3.1.3 Data Analysis

The quantitative data collected through the survey will be analysed using statistical software, such as SPSS or Excel, to generate descriptive statistics, frequency distributions, and cross-tabulations. Inferential analysis, such as chi-square tests or regression analysis, may also be conducted to examine relationships between variables.

3.1.5 Data Integration

The quantitative and qualitative data will be integrated during the interpretation phase of the research. The findings from both components will be compared, contrasted, and synthesised to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research topic.

3.1.6 Ethical Considerations

Ethical considerations will be paramount throughout the data collection process. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants, ensuring their voluntary participation and protection of their confidentiality. Data storage and management will follow best practices for data protection and privacy.

4.      Conclusion
4.1	Closing remarks

In conclusion, this dissertation proposal aims to address the critical gap in the existing literature regarding women in construction project management in the UK. By examining the representation, experiences, and challenges faced by women in this field, this study contributes to the broader discussions on gender diversity, equality, and inclusivity within the construction industry.

It is anticipated that this study will provide a foundation for future research and serve as a catalyst for positive change in addressing gender disparities within the construction industry. By promoting diversity and inclusivity, organisations can harness the full potential of their workforce, leading to improved project outcomes and organisational performance (Smith and Johnson, 2016; Brown, 2019).

My paper focuses on the relationship between academic advisors and student engagement within educational institutions. Specifically, I aim to investigate how we can enhance student engagement in higher education by utilizing academic advisory systems.

One of the reasons I shifted my focus from student retention to student engagement is because I discovered that in the UK, there isn\'t much emphasis on student retention. Instead, the attention in recent years has shifted towards increasing student engagement in universities and colleges. I found that there are distinct differences in academic advising practices between the US and the UK. In the US, there are separate departments dedicated to academic advising and student services, with dedicated academic and professional advisors. However, in British universities, we lack a separate department specifically dedicated to academic advising within student services.

I am particularly interested in investigating about the opinion of  university leaders and managers in university about the role of academic advisors and its relation to student engagement, adding professional coaches and what about the student perception about academic advisors and how they can help them to engage . It seems that budgetary concerns and a lack of support for the additional costs associated with faculty staff providing advising sessions are contributing factors.I have received feedback from my supervisors regarding my literature review chapter, and while I have addressed some of their comments, there are still a few that I have been unable to address on my own. I have been working on the literature review chapter for quite some time, and I believe that with your expertise and guidance. I need to clear the theories used and frame such as  framing of the theory of Tinto, which has been in development for a significant period. Within my literature review chapter, I want to reframe this theory in a more coherent and well-organized manner. I would greatly appreciate your assistance in restructuring the literature review chapter to achieve this objective.Moreover, I also require your help in making amendments to the chapter. Specifically, I need assistance in aligning the research questions that I have added at the end of the chapter. If you feel the need to suggest additional wording or modifications, I am open to your suggestions. I understand that this may require additional effort on your part, and I am willing to compensate you accordingly.

My ultimate goal is to have a literature review chapter that is comprehensive, critical, and well-structured, highlighting any gaps in the existing literature that I can explore in my subsequent research. I kindly request your expertise in transforming my paper from being descriptive to being critical and analytical.
thanks

Begin by defining a clear, specific research question that you aim to answer.

\""How does ESG investing influence the financial performance and stakeholder value of companies in the banking sector in UK?\""

2. Theoretical Framework: 

To provide structure and guidance for your study, you need a solid theoretical framework.

You can rely on the \""Stakeholder Theory\"" to emphasize the importance of addressing multiple stakeholders (including society) in financial decisions. Its main arguments include:

     - Organizations have a responsibility not just to shareholders (who have a financial stake) but also to a broader set of stakeholders—those who can affect or be affected by the actions of the organization.
     - Stakeholders can include employees, customers, suppliers, communities, government agencies, activists, etc.
     - Decisions and policies of organizations should consider and balance the interests of all stakeholders. This could lead to better, more sustainable long-term results for the organization.

Old but foundational papers:
-	Donaldson, T., & Preston, L. E. (1995). The stakeholder theory of the corporation: Concepts, evidence, and implications. Academy of management Review, 20(1), 65-91. ISO 690    
-	Parmar, B. L., Freeman, R. E., Harrison, J. S., Wicks, A. C., Purnell, L., & De Colle, S. (2010). Stakeholder theory: The state of the art. Academy of Management Annals, 4(1), 403-445. ISO 690  

Or Legitimacy Theory which posits that businesses are bound by the social contract in which they operate, and they continuously seek to ensure that their activities are perceived as legitimate by the broader society. Failing to conform to societal expectations can result in sanctions or loss of legitimacy, potentially endangering a company’s very existence. ESG investing, in this context, can be seen as a response to societal demands for more environmentally friendly, socially responsible, and better-governed business practices.

ESG & Financial Performance Relationship:

Below are some research findings that support a positive relationship between ESG & financial performance:

•	Risk Management View: Companies that adopt ESG principles may mitigate potential future risks, especially those related to environmental damages or social discord, leading to better financial performance in the long run.

•	Reputation and Legitimacy: Good ESG practices can enhance a company’s reputation, leading to increased customer loyalty and potentially higher sales.

•	Operational Efficiency: Embracing environmental and social principles might lead to more efficient operations and cost savings, such as through energy savings or waste reduction.

•	Human Capital: Firms with better ESG standards may attract and retain top talent.

•	Access to Capital: Some studies suggest that companies with better ESG ratings have better access to capital and may even face lower capital costs.

These are three highly cited papers in this area:
-	Margolis, J. D., & Walsh, J. P. (2003). Misery loves companies: Rethinking social initiatives by business. Administrative Science Quarterly, 48(2), 268-305.
-	Orlitzky, M., Schmidt, F. L., & Rynes, S. L. (2003). Corporate social and financial performance: A meta-analysis. Organization studies, 24(3), 403-441.
-	Eccles, R. G., Ioannou, I., & Serafeim, G. (2014). The impact of corporate sustainability on organizational processes and performance. Management Science, 60(11), 2835-2857.

These papers offer a broad view of the relationship between corporate social responsibility, including ESG, and financial performance. While the exact relationship might vary across industries and over time, the consensus is that good ESG practices are at the very least not detrimental to financial performance, and they may often be beneficial.

Please also have a look at the recent research that compares sustainability-oriented investors to traditional ones in terms of their performance. (sometimes terms as ESG investing, impact investing and sustainable investing are used to describe the same idea that finance should “support the broad long-term objectives of society rather than simply trying to make profits”). Some important research on this that I can suggest including:

-	Kovner, A., & Lerner, J. (2015). Doing well by doing good? Community development venture capital. Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, 24(3), 643-663.
-	Brest, P., & Born, K. (2013). When can impact investing create real impact. Stanford Social Innovation Review, 11(4), 22-31.
-	Barber, B. M., Morse, A., & Yasuda, A. (2021). Impact investing. Journal of Financial Economics, 139(1), 162-185.
-	Riedl, A., & Smeets, P. (2017). Why do investors hold socially responsible mutual funds?. The Journal of Finance, 72(6), 2505-2550. ISO 690 
-	Hoepner, A. G., Oikonomou, I., Sautner, Z., Starks, L. T., & Zhou, X. (2018). ESG shareholder engagement and downside risk.


3. Data Collection:

   - Primary Data: You can conduct interviews with bank executives or managers who are responsible for ESG investments or strategies. This will provide an insight into how they perceive the impacts on corporate performance and stakeholder value.

   - Secondary Data: But you can also analyse annual reports and sustainability reports of selected banks over a specific period to track ESG initiatives and financial performance. They often detail their ESG strategy and its impacts.

     - If you would like to collect and analyse quantitative data, you can use databases like MSCI ESG Ratings, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg\'s or Morningstar’s ESG Data Service to gather quantitative data on ESG scores and financial metrics. 

4. Methodology:

   - Quantitative Analysis: A regression analysis might be useful in identifying a correlation between ESG ratings and corporate performance metrics (like ROE, stock price, etc.).

  - Qualitative Analysis: You can analyse the content from interviews, annual reports, and other textual data to understand the motivations, strategies, and perceived outcomes (stakeholder perceptions) of ESG investments.

5. Structure:
   - Introduction: Briefly explain ESG and its relevance, especially in the banking sector.
   - Literature Review: Present existing academic literature on ESG, corporate performance, and stakeholder value.
   - Theoretical Framework: Detail the theories mentioned earlier and explain their relevance.
   - Methods: Explain your data collection and analytical methods.
   - Findings: Present your findings from your quantitative or qualitative analysis.
   - Discussion: Discuss the implications of your findings in relation to your research question.
   - Conclusion: Summarize your research.

Please use APA formatting guidelines and using Google Scholar. Academic papers typically follow a standardized format that you can use ( see attached example)

 

The introduction is an important section where you can lay a solid foundation for the entire paper. If you can conduct initial data collection, perform preliminary analysis,  you will be in a strong position to build upon the subsequent sections easily.

General points about posters

Poster presenters are usually offered a large area to display their material (typically 1m square or 2m by 1m).
Posters are usually read at a viewing distance of more than one metre. You will need to make sure that your poster is legible and easy to scan at short distance so that your information is understood quickly.
The temptation to fill the space with as much material as possible should be avoided; poster presentations should never be as dense as a printed page.
Many seminar or workshops organisers supply guidelines suggesting suitable typeface styles and sizes, along with conventions for titles and subheadings. Use these to guide your basic poster design.
When making posters it is essential that you give careful consideration to their visual appearance as well as their content.

There are two popular approaches to making a poster.

Approach one: one-piece method

The presenter chooses to design the poster in one large piece (Figure 6.3). The design is prepared using a versatile software application such as CorelDRAW, Photoshop, MS Publisher, Aldus Freehand or PowerPoint. It is designed and produced in A3 or A4 size and is then enlarged at the printout stage.


Approach 2: panel method

The allocated poster area is divided up into a number of separate panels (Figure 6.4). These may consist of different elements such as text, pictures, tables, or titles. Standard word-processor or presentation software (e.g. Microsoft Word or PowerPoint) is used to prepare the panels which are then mounted onto a background. Laminating the individual elements can improve their appearance and robustness. Choose the production method that is most appropriate to your needs, abilities and resources. The panel method allows for greater flexibility and can be adapted to changing layouts.

I need help with the Results and Discussion section for my dissertation. The attachment contains data for my 30 female participants, anthropometric information, raw logs data and organised log data. To analyse this, I was thinking about using the Chi-Square statistical test.

In my dissertation, I would like to investigate the relationship between regular breakfast consumption and active travel among adolescent girls due to their physical inactivity and frequent absences from breakfast. Accordingly, there has been no consistency in whether breakfast affects physical activity among studies published so far, and the link between breakfast and physical activity among adolescents remains unclear and needs further study. This study aims to test the correlation between breakfast consumption and active travel to determine whether breakfast consumption can significantly affect active travel during the same school day. It is hypothesised that adolescent girls who consume breakfast are more likely to participate in active travel. Based on previous findings, it is reasonable to hypothesise that breakfast consumption may positively impact active travel in adolescent girls. Eating breakfast could provide the energy and nutrients needed for physical activity, resulting in active travel to school.",,,,,,,,,,,,[],175.45,8.77,166.68,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

1. Introduction to the organization, providing a clear description of its path dependency, purpose and current business profile. Hint: The introduction can be included in the Executive Summary to avoid exceeding the word count.

2. Situation analysis, using module theories and frameworks to diagnose an organisation’s situation by critically analysing its external and internal environments.

3. Problem analysis, identifying aspects of your chosen organization that give cause for concern, describing the symptoms you have observed and providing credible sources as justification for your concerns. As a good place to start this aspect of the analysis, you might ask the question, ‘Is there a dissonance between what the organisation’s mission/vision statement expresses and what is seen by the consumer of the organisation’s product/processes/services? This might include product or process issues, increased competition, declining popularity, poor on-line reviews, declining sales revenues. You should also clearly identify those problems that are truly wicked and distinguish between problems that are soft or tractable.

4. Problem explanation, which identifies the causes (e.g. organisational characteristics) that might have led to the problems observed, providing reasoning for any claims that are made in the report.

5. Triage, the problems identified. Discuss which of the problems are considered, by the project team to fall into the following categories:
A. Critical. Those problems that require the greatest application of resources to prevent further decline in organizational health.
B. Intermediate. Those problems which are not considered critical, but if left un-resolved, will eventually become critical or have a long-term impact on the business.
C. Tertiary. Those problems that, while they appear important, might be monitored in the short-term.

6. Direction setting. Apply a range of module theories and frameworks for describing and setting an organisational direction. This could involve scenario planning and/or looking at innovative new entrants to the markets in which the organisation is competing.

7. Options analysis that identifies and discusses business strategy options that might, if implemented correctly, provide suitable solutions to the problems identified.

8. Recommendations, based upon the options that are most likely to lead to sustainable performance.

9. Implementation, provides a focus on the key actions that need to be taken and the key performance indicators that might be used to monitor the implementation and effectiveness of the remedial strategy.

I endeavored to explore the relationship between childhood asthma and breastfeeding, constrained by the inability to conduct interviews. In my attempt to encapsulate this inquiry, I embarked on crafting my dissertation titled \'The Role of Breastfeeding in Mitigating Childhood Asthma: A Comprehensive Narrative Literature Review.\' Regrettably, my initial submission earned a score of 40/100, falling short of the requisite 50 for success. Given the significance of this final opportunity, I am earnestly seeking your assistance to elevate the quality of my dissertation, aiming for an impressive score within the range of 80-85. Your expertise and guidance in refining the content would be immensely appreciated, as success in this endeavor holds paramount importance for me. 

The dissertation is required to adhere to a word count ranging from 12,000 to 15,000 words, excluding references, the table of contents, acknowledgments, and appendices. Attached, you\'ll find pertinent documents, including my dissertation template, feedback from previous submissions, the dissertation handbook, and an exemplary dissertation provided by my lecturer. This exemplary piece encompasses tables, the Prisma diagram, and other essential elements.

Ideally, the content should draw from the most recent findings, emphasizing studies conducted within the last five years. If available data proves insufficient, extending the timeframe is acceptable, but the focus should remain on more recent research, avoiding excessively dated sources.

Given these resources, I kindly seek your assistance in crafting the dissertation within a 20-day timeframe. Your expertise is crucial in ensuring the production of a document that is not only high-quality but also well-structured. Your support in meeting this deadline is greatly appreciated.

Tong, E. M., Tan, C. R., Latheef, N. A., Selamat, M. F., & Tan, D. K. (2008). Conformity: moods matter. European Journal of Social Psychology, 38(4), 601-611. The proposal should fill a knowledge gap in the existing research and I should be able to come up with something that can answer the question \'so what\' therefore why is it important to fill this gap from the perspective of social psychology. The paper from Tong, which is the starting point of the research focuses on Information Conformity, whereas I would like to focus on Normative Conformity. The attachments here have a detailed structure for the design of the proposal including introduction, literature review, method, ethics.....and so on. Considering the paper Drace, S., & Efendic, E. (2020). The effect of specific emotions on conformity. Psihologija, 00, 38–38. https://doi.org/10.2298/psi200109038d (WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO BE INCLUDED IN MY LIT REVIEW) I was hoping that my hypothesis could be focusing on the opposite hypothesis of the seminal paper from Tong et al., and therefore that participants in a negative mood may show more conformity than participants in a happy mood) as this one would justify why I am using the original paper. I have been advised by my lecturer to  try to unpick why the contradiction is occurring here and what are the gaps in the more modern research in this area. In terms of methods, I would like to go for QUALITATIVE, rather than quantitative. Please find below the advice of my lecturer regarding this:
\'You can certainly ask people through interviews about their thoughts on mood and conformity, or you could make this an open ended survey question. If your study is online you could end it with an open text section. This will mean most participants will respond and you could do a textual analysis to see general trends (rather than a deep thematic analysis of many respondents).
You could also do a story stem where perhaps you present a story of someone who is in a bad mood and encounters an opportunity to conform to a group and get participants to complete the story. That would be an interesting way of seeing wider perceptions of mood and conformity. You could even present some with a good mood and some with a bad mood\'.

I WOULD SAY THAT USING THE SUGGESTED STORY STEM SEEMS LIKE A GOOD WAY TO PROCEED, IF POSSIBLE.

For qualitative we are not looking for broad, generalisable information. So sample size for interviews is around 8-12 and story stem is anything beyond 20 participants.
 
PLEASE, PLEASE let me know if you want me to provide any more elements from the lecture\'s slides and I would be grateful if I could speak to someone as I understand that this may be too much information and I really woul like to get this right. 
Thank you so much",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Assessment 2 social psychology template for research proposal ER rev 2023.docx\"",\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Helpsheet for experiment design.docx\"",\""\"",\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Social and Evolutionary psychology assignment 2 MSc 23-24.docx\""]",159.6,7.98,151.62,,,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0000-00-00 00:00:00

The following are the sections you would expect to find within an evidence-based practice (EBP) project protocol. Note: Assignments should be submitted as a Word document, use a font size 11 and be double spaced.

Project title
Give a project title, this will usually contain elements from your PCC, PICO, SPIDER mnemonic. 
The title should be succinct and clearly speak to the topic area (view articles for examples of how titles and research questions differ).

Project Summary (one page)
A summary of up to one page in length is compulsory and should outline all the central elements of the protocol; the rationale, aim of review, objectives, search strategy, and expected outcomes. It should stand on its own, and not refer the reader to points in the protocol (summaries do not have references in them and all acronyms must be spelt out).

Introduction and rationale to the study
Outline the clinical topic to be addressed and why it is important to conduct this review of the literature. The rationale should be supported by literature such as government policy documents, reports and key research papers. Undertake a preliminary search of ‘one’ database (e.g., PubMed, Medline, Web of Science) with preliminary search terms to inform your introduction and rationale. It is essential that you are aware of what empirical work has been undertaken as it is not acceptable to undertake a review if one that addresses your issue has already been undertaken in the past two years. You will need to report your search strategy for the preliminary search and results in the introduction section. 

Review question, aim, objectives
Use a mnemonic (e.g., PICO, SPIDER, PCC) to develop and outline the components of a robust question that will frame the review of literature and inform the search strategy.
State your review question, aim of review, and review objectives.

Methods
Outline the search strategy that will be followed, including search terms and synonyms, Boolean operators, the databases to be searched with rationale, and the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Detail your inclusion and exclusion criteria in a table. Inclusion criteria are likely to include:  
Date range: that included studies will have been published within (and justify choice)
Study design: This relates to the ‘type’ of empirical evidence that your review will be seeking to retrieve. So, depending on your review question, think about what sort of evidence is likely to answer the question. The evidence you seek can be broadly defined under the following headings: qualitative or quantitative studies, intervention or observational studies, or you could be specific, such as RCTs or quasi-experimental studies. You need to provide a justification for ‘Why’ you are seeking the type of evidence that you are. 
Setting/context: Especially for qualitative reviews, indicate what setting (clinical, community, etc) that is the focus of the topic under review (think broadly regarding setting and context).  
Population: Indicate the types of participants papers would need to refer to for the study to be included in your final review.  
Outcomes: Identify the outcomes you are interested in; this should directly relate to your review question. 
Study selection
In this section you will tell the reader how you will select evidence to be included in your review. Remember that in this protocol you are explaining ‘How’ this is done as you will not do this until you undertake the search in your dissertation module. 
Remember that you will have undertaken an initial review to inform your introduction and so this section only refers to how you propose to select articles for inclusion in your dissertation summative review. 
Study selection is usually conducted in two stages: 1) an initial screening of titles and abstracts of the ‘hits’ (outcome of your searches) against the inclusion criteria you have generated and justified to identify potentially relevant papers and 2) by screening of the full papers (that pass stage 1) identified as relevant. The protocol should specify the process by which decisions on the selection of studies will be made. 

Quality assessment/critical appraisal
A review should be based on the best quality evidence available. Whatever the study design(s) included, do not assume all studies of the same design (e.g., RCT) are equally well-conducted. The quality of the included studies should be formally assessed as this will impact on the reliability of the results and therefore on the conclusions drawn. Identify the tools (e.g., CASP, or other) that you will apply when you critique the retrieved evidence (again this happens in dissertation) but you need to tell the reader ‘How’ you intend to assess the quality of the studies included in your dissertation summative review.    

Data extraction
The protocol should outline the information that will be extracted from included studies and the procedure for data extraction, including any data extraction tools/proforma to be used. 

Data synthesis or analysis
The protocol should specify the strategy for data synthesis/analysis of the findings from the final retrieved studies. Remember that you will not do this until dissertation, but you tell the reader ‘What’ you intend to do and ‘Why’ you have proposed that approach. 

Dissemination
Outline how the results/findings from the review will be shared with service providers (and service users if appropriate) including ‘How’ you will disseminate your findings (what methods will you use) and ‘Why’ you are proposing that method. 

Conclusion
In this section generate some concluding comments relating to the outcome of the EBP and the potential of the EBP to inform your practice and your profession. This section is usually short and concise and should not introduce any new commentary.

References 
Full references of all the literature cited in preceding sections should be listed and should adhere to the Harvard format. 


Appendices
Any appendices necessary to assist the reader to understand the processes within the study protocol, e.g.  data extraction tools, critical appraisal tools must be listed in appendices (separate page of each). You will need to include the process by which you will select papers (reduction process from hits to final papers e.g., Prisma flow diagram) for inclusion in your summative dissertation.

If required, I can provide lecture notes in word document format on all the different topics for the module. The topics we have gone through are: the general linear model, multiple regression, categorical regression, mixed continuous categorical regression, mediation and moderation, NHST and the replication crisis, repeated measures designs, binary logistic regressions, and bayes-LaPlace and the p value.
Graphs should be included, I believe, as discused in the assignment brief- as visualisations through Jamovi.
The assignment should be written in APA format.
The lecturer has said that this is a mixed between-within subjects design. 
Uploading the data file isn\'t working, considering it is a .omv file. Therefore, I have attached the data as an excel file, which may need to be pasted into Jamovi.

The Assignment Brief
To help you structure your essay you should follow the points below:
 
	Select a substance PLEASE NO THAT MY SELECTED SUBSTANCE IS: (ALCOHOL)
o	Briefly explain the chosen substance and outline it using social, historical, and cultural context.
o	Define the different concepts and explanations regarding; use, problem use, and dependence on the chosen substance.
 
 
o	Discuss national patterns and trends regarding the substance, please use institutional reports to correctly describe the prevalence in the essay (make sure that at level 6 UK prevalence statistics are present in the essay with a little criticism towards the measure used). 
 
 
o	Choose 3 theories of addiction describe and evaluate them (IMPORTANT: you must use empirical evidence appropriately and support its influence or efficacy in explaining addiction). Thereafter, compare the theories evaluated with the WHO Model of Dependence: Bio-psycho-social model (this will be your third theory in the assignment, make sure you describe what the WHO Biopsychosocial model is, and use it to highlight the complexity of addiction through synergy of the different paradigms discussed). 
 
Discuss the implications for practice. If you are unable to apply this to practice due to lack of experience you can discuss what each model adds to understanding of ‘Addiction’ in the field. Furthermore, you may want to highlight the synergy of the theories. This may be used to explain how different models and theories of addiction support and explain different aspects (i.e. they all add to our current understanding of addiction but no particular theory in isolation can comprehensively explain addiction)

Unfortunately, I didn\'t pass it and I\'m struggling with this.
The work is based on a current research carried out by my tutor. As part of the final assessment, he asked students to choose and develop the best statistical method to answer the main research questions (detailed in the attached documents), according to the SPSS data provided.

I would need academic help to choose and develop a different statistical research design, as the one I made was not the most suitable, according to my tutor (explained in the Assessment_corrections document)

 I would need:
Between 375/400 words, approximately, to rewrite \""Methods\"" section; and 
Between 375/400 words, approximately, to rewrite the \""Results\"" section.
(This is an estimation, as the total word maximum is 3500 words for the whole paper).


I also need to edit some parts following the suggestions given by my tutor to modify my paper in order to pass my Module.

 All the information is explained in detail within the attached documents. The document containing my final project is: \""Final_Res_Methods_for_review\"".

The academic style to follow is the APA  style.

It should not just be writing down your first reaction or what you already know.			
Reflection involves critical thinking, which means rethinking your existing knowledge and previously held opinions in light of what we have learned about theories of ethics, logic, and reasoning. You will need to question your current knowledge and beliefs. Discuss the main points of the debate, what stance you take, support that stance, and discuss the opposing argument. Also, discuss an ethical theory that would apply to defend your view.			
To complete each scenario assignment:			
1.       Complete the entire scenario.			
2.       Fill out the template attached below, ask your professor for details on submission.			
3.       Compose the last question on the template reflection in a Word document and be sure to address, at a minimum, the following questions:			
Why do you feel the way you do about the issue presented?			
Of the four responses offered in the scenario, which do you think is the most ethical and why?			
Which ethical theory would you use to support your stance? Why does this theory work?			
4.       Support your conclusions with evidence and specific examples from the textbook, including a minimum of one theory of ethics to defend your stance.

here are some lecture notes but these are just to give an idea as to what we\'ve been studying.
•	The proponents of neo-liberalism see charitable development as a means to enforce their desired social order consensually.
•	NGOs are presented with a choice between focusing on political engagement to challenge social systems or continuing philanthropic work that may inadvertently support existing oppressive structures.
•	Language used by NGOs to control Africa. Was ‘uncivilised’ shifted to ‘underdeveloped’.
•	Outflows – honest accounts 
•	GDP – taylor
•	Some NGOs, including Oxfam, Save the Children, and Christian Aid, show some consciousness of the need to engage in supporting emancipatory movements.
•	Examples include involvement in campaigns to end debt and support for human rights.
•	NGOs are warned that if they choose not to support emancipatory movements, they risk becoming complicit in the crimes of oppressive systems.
•	Tearfund example. 
•	Aid is seen as a form of oppression dividing national unity. Elite and class formation. Aid is disguised as ‘extremely positive’ which is a deformed way of gaining control. 
•	Altruistic – as a means of control. 
•	Remittances. 
•	Rolling back the sovereignty of the state. Upwards and downwards. Explosive increase of NGOs. Opportunistic side. 
•	Which NGOs are now relevant?
•	Scramble – FOWLER 
•	AID chain: Government doors – INGOs (Scramble) – SNGOs – COAST as an organisation supporting the initiation of SNGOs. 
•	Technocratic: depoliticizing it. Managerial. Emptying of politics. 
•	British NGOs are not needed on the ground but teach how to go into project management methods. Management consultancy. Political wing – lobbying government around British aid program. 
•	New public management 
•	Legitimacy – for the agent who provides social services. 
•	Decolonize but not structural relationships. 
•	KPIs 
•	Patron-client relations in the aid chain. 
•	Inorganic but embedded – organizations – created and incorporated.
•	Mining – the structure of the economy that spawns mirid aid relationships. 
•	SAPs created from primary commodity. Uganda – NGOs had to front a lot of money. NGOs became policy makers in Uganda.

(2)STATE POLICY IMF WB
(3)WELFAARE GAP - NGOS
1980s & 90s: The End of Development?
In debt levels of Ghana and Kenya are huge. Provided, how did this situation that is still dominant today come from? Why is it still prevalent? Two areas: indebtedness (why it\'s so crucial), and who provides social assistance (this is today\'s focus). 
National Goal: Economic and social development replaced by debt outflows and developmentalism replaced by neoliberalism.
1.	Social transformation lost.
2.	Ongoing outflow of debt repayments.
3.	Narrowing of policymaking.
4.	Decreasing role of the African state. Because international financial institutions (IMF and World Bank) are the ones making policy due to influence.
5.	Increasing role of IFIs.
6.	Increasing role of NGOs (Hearn 1998-2007).
7.	Initial welcome of the ‘Beijing Consensus’ in the 2000s. 
The ideology of Neoliberalism – what is at the center? 3 sector models of society: Private, Public, and Voluntary. NEOLIBERALISM: Shrink the state and increase the private sector – which relies on people funding it. Voluntary is about helping other individuals. 
Power of Neoliberalism (lenders) – why is it able to influence? Countries were at bankruptcy so used neoliberal organizations for funds. 
•	Bankruptcy, austerity, poverty
•	National: Aid Economies
•	Grassroots: Micro-level intervention NGOs
•	Power Relations – who is weakened, who is strengthened?
Sectors
•	Private Sector: The ‘Market’
•	Public Sector: The State 
•	Voluntary Sector: Charities
SAP-created Poverty: ‘Gap-filler’, ‘Safety Net’
The greatest need for welfare services – increased poor.
Pull back of state welfare services – gap-fillers.
Aid: Disempowering, humiliation
Aid more than anything else shows the humiliation of Africa. The level of aid dependence: 
•	‘Aid agencies have thus become the policymakers of our countries.’   
•	‘Aid, more than any other aspects that characterise the relationship between the developed world and Africa, represents the humiliation of Africa’.
  (A.M. Babu 1994)
‘aid became a surrogate for domestically derived revenue’
‘Uganda\'s exports were valued at US$232 million in 1990, yet its imports amounted to US$745 million’. IMF stepped in to balance payment around trade.
‘1992/93 when foreign donors were asked to supply US$333 million out of a total budget of US$409.6 million.’ The level of aid dependency.
Himbara, D., & Sultan, D. (1995) ‘Reconstructing the Ugandan state and economy: the challenge of an international Bantustan’ Review of African Political Economy, 22(63), 85-93.
Aid industry 
What this meant was there wasn’t just dependency on aid but personnel. 
In the late 1980s, some 100,000 expats were working in SSA in various technical assistance schemes funded by international agencies – a greater number than at independence.
World Bank (1995) The African Capacity Building Initiative: Toward Improved Policy Analysis and Development Management in SSA
The shift in power relations 
‘Recent changes in the aid policies of developed countries … [are] best understood as a return to pre-World War Two patterns in the relationship between the West and others.’ Williams (1997: 227-28).
How aid is recognising countries like Mozambique. This quote is saying whole 60s and 70s of independence has been knocked back to 1945. 
Aid Institutions
(1)	Multilateral: World Bank & IMF, UN system (1945) with agencies e.g., UNICEF; UNDP (Human Development Report): shift the focus away from macroeconomics into poverty and marginalised people in development programs. Aid isn’t just grants it loans.
(2)	Bilateral (DFID; SIDA; CIDA; DANIDA; USAID): foreign policy arm of government. 
(3)	Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs): citizens to citizens, non-state actors. 
Definition of development NGOs
‘Independent development actors existing apart from governments and corporations, operating on a non-profit or not-for-profit basis with an emphasis on voluntarism, and pursuing a mandate of providing development services, undertaking communal development work or advocating on development issues.’ Michael (2004) Undermining Development: The Absence of Power among Local NGOs in Africa, Oxford: James Currey. 
The 1980s ‘NGO revolution’
•	From state welfare to neoliberalism and a safety net.
•	Voluntary sector from the margins to centre stage.
•	Western state funding: Official aid as a percentage of total NGO income.  Early 1970s 1.5%, mid-1990s 30% (Gary 1996: 149).
•	Oxfam, Christian Aid, made a threshold of how much governments can give. They want to maintain their position of independent grassroots – the government has no influence. 
•	NGO doing work of state department. 

Range of Organisation 
Not every NGO is the same, no homogenisation.
The whole spectrum of individual organisations within the voluntary sector.
Grassroots, autonomous of states and self-funded to funded by and aligned with states.
Billy Graham missions all over African countries: American evangelical. 
Themes
(1)	Non-governmental?  Independence
(2)	Relationship to neoliberalism - Why are charities needed? IMF and WB created new poverty. So, some say if charities hadn’t stepped in the state wouldn’t have withdrawn so much – would be much more revolution.
(3)	Sustainability – what’s the point in people only going there for a week?
(4)	Accountability

•	Political change - social movements – or depoliticization?
•	Development – societal transformation – or localism, projects? Meaning of development changes with NGOs. What are the sources of income in these countries? Economic base focus. For a country to develop it needs to industrialise. Macroeconomic political economy issues. What NGOs do is they change definition of development fron primary commodities and manfucaturers to local level development. For African countries NGOs help on basic survival levels because the mandate and vision is narrow. 
•	Charity or rights?  Citizenship vs victimhood. The social contract between citizens and state.
•	Creates a misleading narrative of direction of aid. Why not talk about remittances – no white saviour conflict. Economic flow out of Africa dwarfs aid.
Postcolonial Narrative that needs to be changed: The ‘White Saviour Complex’.
•	Generosity – theft hidden.
•	Gratitude
•	Power relationship: Superiority-inferiority or equality (Said 1978)?
•	Media
•	NGOs
Key reading: Manji & O’Coill (2002)
Conclusion
•	Sectoral: Shrinking of the public sector, expansion of the voluntary sector
•	Structural: Root causes of poverty
•	Discourse: Misleading, post-colonial narrative

INSTRUCTION 

Instructions Final Assessment: Legal Blog Post

For the final assessment of the Europe and Climate Change course, you are asked to write a legal blog. The final assessment is worth 60% of your grade. Below you can find further instructions on writing a legal blog post. General information on blogging is taken from the Legal Skills Academy 2-Page Guide on Legal Blogging, which you are strongly encouraged to consult in addition to this document.

What is a legal blog post? 

A blog post is a short written piece designed to be placed on an online webpage. Blog posts are generally shorter than academic papers, and are increasingly used to comment on ongoing and new developments, with a more immediate and widespread reach. For legal scholars, the exercise of writing a blog post pushes you to think hard about the main message of your research in order to distil a key legal problem and formulate your own position in a succinct and accessible manner. This skill is valuable for your professional development, as blogging is increasingly used by academics and practitioners. 

Blog topic:

For this course, you are asked to write a blog analysing a further development of European climate protection law and/or climate liability cases. You may draw on the material discussed during the course. The topic of your blog must not be the same as that of your small-group presentation. It is recommended that you base your blog on a limited selection of legal sources, for example, one new climate case or one EU legislative proposal. 

Blog style and format:

The tone of your writing needs to be accessible for your blog audience. For this assignment we assume that your blog audience consists of the wider public interested in the exciting developments in EU climate protection law. This means that your tone will be less formal than in an academic paper, revealing your own opinions more directly. On the other hand, the tone is more formal than on personal social media (such as Instagram or Twitter).
The title of your blog is particularly important for hooking the audience. The title should be related to a clearly defined blog topic. Try to avoid unnecessary acronyms as your wide readership may not be as familiar as you are with the ins-and-outs of legal jargon. Relatedly, you should then also define all legal terms used in your blog for non-specialist readers.  
The blog must be filled into the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard. In addition, you may wish to add a relevant visual to get the audience’s attention. Please ensure that the visual is appropriate and clearly related to your blog topic. Make sure that you have permission to use the image, i.e. that it is not subject to copyright restrictions. You will also need to acknowledge the source. Some suggested image databases can be found here: https://unsplash.com/  &  Flickr: Creative Commons.
Be sure to reference your sources throughout the blog. This should be done as a hyperlink for online sources, and a footnote for other sources. Links to further information may also be of interest for the reader. This may be included as a hyperlink or added separately at the end of the blog.
An example of a very good blog post written by a Utrecht University Renforce researcher can be found on Blackboard, and online here.

Publication of the blogs

The aim of this assignment is to develop a blog that can be published online. The course instructors are currently seeking an outlet for a selection of the best blogs. You may also wish to publish your blog through your own social media channels. We ask that you do this using the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard.

Formal requirements:
	Maximum word length: 1700 words. 
	References to sources: hyperlinks to online resources, and footnotes to other sources. Footnote formatting may be in a style of choice (e.g. OSCOLA, Harvard etc), but must be consistent. 
	Correct use of Utrecht University template (available on Blackboard).
	Submission: please submit your blog post through Blackboard by Tuesday 23 January at 14.00.

This is a two-page guide written for students explaining how and why writing a blog post could be useful in your
education.

What is blogging and what is the difference between a blog and a blog post?

A weblog or blog is a webpage containing a collection of entries, often referred to as posts. These blog posts are
normally of about 500 to 2000 words and they bring a particular message/argument/news item or idea.

Why should you blog?

There are at least three reasons to blog. Firstly, blogging can help you distribute your research findings which
otherwise would be only used for your academic paper or thesis. In this way, you can contribute to society during
your master’s education (see this video about this idea).
Secondly, you may be asked to write a blog post once you start your professional career. Judges, law firms, public
authorities and academics increasingly use blogs to comment on ongoing developments and circulate new research,
judgements and opinions. Blogging has become a way to deliver academic ideas, as it has a more immediate and
widespread reach. Its form mean blog posts often have a broader appeal than traditional (legal) publications.
Thirdly, the exercise of writing a blog posts pushes you to think hard about the key message of your research, which, if
combined with writing a lengthy paper or thesis, can often promote the quality of the latter. This is because writing a
short blog post requires you to distil the key problem of your research and formulate your position/finding on it.
As a side remark, whereas you could write a blog post for an existing blog, you could also set up your own blog for
free (see e.g. how to do this in this instruction). This exercise will certainly help you to advance further your IT skills.

When might you write a blog post?
Some teachers use legal blogging in their class as an obligatory part of the final grade (see my example). You could
also decide to write a blog post yourself. Ask the teacher of the course you really like which blogs exist in that area
and discuss how he/she could help you in connecting to the editors of that blog or write to those editors on your own.
Writing a blog post for an existing blog will involve a peer-review process. The comments and suggestions from those
peer-reviewers could promote the quality of your blog post and research in that area.

Are there any reasons to be cautious?

So far we have discussed why and how blogging can be useful and fun to do. At the same time, it is important to be
cautious about what you put online and how. Be considerate about the sensitivity of certain topics and think carefully
about how ‘judgmental’ you wish to be, if you are still a student. In some areas, it may be better to opt for a more
descriptive and neutral writing style in order to avoid undesirable comments (also in your future career) if you are not
yet the expert in the field of writing. Also, make sure to give a disclaimer if you are uncertain about certain things or if
they are simply your thoughts or assumptions. Ask whether relevant persons in your network will check it before you
send it for publication, so that they can reflect on the final text for both substance and grammar. Make sure to use
hyperlinks, pictures and videos that are allowed to be distributed and respect copy right.


Tips to get started

You write a blog post with the aim that it is going to be read. Here are some tips to make your post more attractive
and encourage your reader to read it. Please, note, that many people read only the first paragraph of a blog post to
get the key message out of it. Therefore, tip number 1 is to make sure that your first paragraph summarizes your key
argument or message!
Make your blog post accessible to your target audience
When writing a blog post, bear in mind your target audience. In academia, blogging is a way of delivering academic
ideas that can accompany journal articles or outline directions for further research practice. It is a good advertisement
for your published or forthcoming paper or book, future or past event-discussion. Your target audience may also be
legal professionals. In any case, online blogposts have an advantage of reaching many more people as they are
available worldwide. So, make sure to employ that advantage: the easier the language of the blog post, the more
successful it will be in this regard!
To make your blog post accessible, make sure that:
• you do not use any excessive legal jargon, that only a niche of academics might be familiar with;
• you use short sentences and any possible difficult terms or words are hyperlinked to a page explaining them;
and
• you put your topic in a broader context. So, if you describe a recent judicial decision or opinion, for example,
give a really brief summary of past-precedents and the state of the art of the law in simple words. This will
be helpful for those readers who are not fully familiar with the topic.

Play with tone and visual effects

Depending on the type of audience and the topic addressed, you may like to use a different tone. Unlike journal
articles, writers of blogposts are in principle freer to experiment with language and different sorts of writing.
However, this may vary per blog platform: some blogs prefer to have a rather academic journal-like style of writing.
The length of a post may vary as well but normally is between 500 and 2000 words. Your blogpost could be more
captivating with:
• multimedia and visual aids such as video links, tables and schemes;
• anecdotal descriptions and/or first-person accounts of a topic; and
• personal insights, experiences and statements.
Be aware of coherence, structure and the law
Style should not come to the detriment of coherence and clear structure. 
To that end:
• Structure your blogpost with (sub)headings, depending on the text length. Headings need not be numbered
but it is useful if they are catchy;
• Ensure that there is an introduction which clearly states the main message, followed by a body of arguments
building towards that main message;
• Be reminded that, obviously, the prohibition of plagiarism and copyrights (if you use multimedia) extends to
blogposts;
• Make the content scannable, such that the reader can get the gist even without an in-depth read; and
• Go straight to the point: do not be afraid of spoilers, especially in the title – a clear title can make your blog
easily discoverable on the internet.

Your portfolio will assemble three pieces of work that together allow you to demonstrate that you have met the module learning outcomes. The full portfolio is due at once, as a single submission and will be graded as a single submission.

Every reading and every exercise in the textbook is preparing you to complete the assessment. The exact tasks will be released once you have had the chance to study enough material to understand the tasks. Indeed, many of the exercises will provide draft material that you might included in your portfolio items (though in practice you are likely to use the understanding you developed and re-draft it to be focused on the relevant portfolio task). You will have time after the end of the teaching semester to compile, edit and polish your portfolio.

Your mastery of the material you have studied will be assessed through a portfolio, which is a collection of smaller pieces of work that together allow you to demonstrate that you have met the learning objectives. The full portfolio is due at once, as a single submission and will be graded as a single submission.

At the broadest level, the portfolio items are as follows:

A visual model that explains a buyer behaviour process and its relationship to key marketing decisions.
A written piece demonstrating your ability to apply buyer behaviour and marketing management concepts to explaining marketing phenomena that you have observed.
A short essay on an issue of marketing ethics.
Each of the portfolio items is outlined in more detail below. The details of each item are included in the Assessment Chapter in the textbook (to enable cross referencing).

Assessment at university has only one task: to examine how well students have understood, can apply, and critically evaluate the material presented for study in a module.

Be clear that you have not been guided to learn how to undertake academic research. You should only use the concepts you have studied in the textbook and external readings. You may use examples from your marketing portfolio and your reading of the Financial Times and the Economist to help illustrate you points and arguments.

If you use conceptual material from outside the module, this will have a number of negative consequences:

You will gain zero marks for the use of that material.
You will distract yourself from proving you understand and can work with (apply, analyse, evaluate) the material you have been asked to study.
If you are tempted to search online, instead use the search function in the textbook (top right of every page), the textbook\'s Glossary of Technical Terms, and text search in your browser and/or PDF reader as you read the external material.

You may create new material. But, that creation must be a clear extension of the material you have been tasked to study. You did this as you synthesised a buyer behaviour model in exercises 2.7 and 2.12.

Note: Conceptual material means the abstract concepts, frameworks and theories that you have studied, and then applied in the practical exercises. Buyer behaviour models, for example,  are conceptual because the generally describe the structure of buying rather than any one particular instance. You have practiced going back and forth between the conceptual and empirical (data) by, for example, specifying the models based on data you have gathered. Most obviously you did this when you asked your classmates about specific needs and wants, etc..    

Focus on content not appearance for visual models and diagrams
You are welcome to draw diagrams (as we have in class), photograph them, and insert the photograph in your portfolio. So long as it is readable, this will be fine. It is better to concentrate on the content (analysis and arguments) than spending the time trying to make it pretty.

Referencing
It is important that you reference properly. This means:

Each time you introduce a concept or repeat a fact, it should have a citation.
For your work with me, please also include the page number(s). Examples: \""Mitussis, et al, 2022:s12.12\"", \""Dibb, 1998:p396\"". This is useful in your note taking because it helps you quickly refresh your mind about the details.
If you cite somebody\'s idea but you have not read their work, you must be clear about that. For example: \""Maslow (1943) as cited by Burnett (2011:pp95-96).\""
Correct bibliographic entries at the end of your work.
We introduced you to referencing in Section 2.6.1 of the textbook, and hope that you have been practising it as you have been writing your notes and exercises.

Different disciplines, journal and universities will have different traditions for the exact formatting, but the principles are the same everywhere.

If an idea, structure, concept, theory, or framework is not yours, you must cite the source when you use it, and include the bibliographic details in your final document.
If the words are not yours, you must quote the words, cite the source in your document when you quote them, and include the bibliographic details in your final document.
LLMs produce content. The output of the LLM should be treated the same way as any other sources.

If an idea, structure, concept, theory, or framework is not yours (because it came from ChatGPT, Google Bard or some other LLM), you must cite the source when you use it, and include the bibliographic details in your final document.
If the words are not yours (because they came from ChatGPT, Google Bard or some other LLM), you must quote the words, cite the source in your document when you quote them, and include the bibliographic details in your final document.
There is an additional complication.

When you use an idea from a source (such as the textbook or one of the journal articles you have been prompted to read) you cite it and include the full bibliographic details in your assessment. A reader can therefore quickly find the source to understand and/or check your use of those ideas or words.

But, LLMs do not work the same way. When you use them you supply input text and it generates a response based on its huge statistical language model. A reader has no easy way to engage with source if you only cite the source and provide the full bibliographic entry.

So, if you use LLMs you must engage in an additional step:

Provide a note (e.g., footnote or endnote) that explains what prompt you gave the model, what response it gave, and how you adapted that response. 

Notes such as these will not be counted in any word or page limits.
As an aside, this practice of using footnotes or endnotes to explain sources in some detail is not new. Before journal articles were easily available on the internet, authors would include these notes because they knew that readers might not be easily able to access the same sources (not all libraries had physical copies of the same sources).

Note: With permission, this section is an edited version of material that will be included in the next version of the textbook (Mitussis, et al, forthcoming).


Relevance of LLMs to your Marketing Principles coursework
Having said all of that, using LLMs (including, but not exclusively, ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing, etc) will not be helpful with the substance of your assignment:

If you have worked steadily on the exercises, at the time of writing (week 7) you will have an early draft of two of your three portfolio items.
The LLMs do not have access to the textbook or journal articles, so you cannot take for granted that they provide responses that prove you understand and can apply the concepts, theories and frameworks as presented in the module.
The LLMs are very poor at producing the kinds of tabular information that you need to create for all three portfolio items.
In order to evaluate the output of the LLMs to know if it is useful for your portfolio, you have to develop sufficient expertise from studying the textbook and external sources, and working steadily on the exercises. If you do that, it will be quicker, and produce better results, if you write up that understanding yourself.
As we explored in week six\'s Thursday class, LLMs will be useful for you, once you are sufficiently expert to evaluate their output. Your job at university is to develop that expertise. 
Word count

Portfolios will be graded so that excellent grades can be achieved within the page and word limits and on the back of 150 hours of study (including time working directly on the portfolio).

The page limit for item one is a hard limit. No marks will be awarded for a visual model or notes that appear on the third or subsequent page. References, of course, can be on subsequent pages.

There are no penalties for deviating from word guidance for items two and three. However, be careful. Work longer than the guide likely does not demonstrate careful choice between what is important and what is not. Shorter work likely does not provide sufficient detail. Both of these are reasons for not being awarded higher grades.

Do not repeat yourself
You may cross reference other parts of your portfolio. For example, in item three you might follow the same marketing management process your described in item one. In which case, do not repeat, simply say something like: \""The lunch shop analysis below follows the marketing management process outlined in item one (above)\"".

The same applies to key concepts. If you use a particular term, cite the textbook or journal article that defines and explains it, and use your words to show that you can apply or critique it. This allows you to show off higher level work.

Portfolio Submission
Submit your portfolio as a single file using the \""Portfolio Submission (Dropbox)\"" link. You will need to submit your portfolio as a single file, in either Microsoft Word or PDF format.

The link will become visible closer to the submission deadline.

Do not make the mistake of assuming that, because you cannot see the relationship between a reading or exercise that you are asked to do now, that the reading or exercise is not essential to the development of knowledge and skills that are needed in the assessment. 

You will not have assessment tasks that test a given topic or task. You will have assessment tasks that test how well you understand and can apply the whole module (and which of course would be unreasonable for you to be able to understand properly now).

Work longer than the guide likely does not demonstrate careful choice between what is important and what is not. Shorter work likely does not provide sufficient detail. Both of these are reasons for not being awarded higher grades.

Do not repeat yourself
You may cross reference other parts of your portfolio. For example, in item three you might follow the same marketing management process your described in item one. In which case, do not repeat, simply say something like: \""The lunch shop analysis below follows the marketing management process outlined in item one (above)\"".

The same applies to key concepts. If you use a particular term, cite the textbook or journal article that defines and explains it, and use your words to show that you can apply or critique it. This allows you to show off higher level work.

Portfolio Submission
Submit your portfolio as a single file using the \""Portfolio Submission (Dropbox)\"" link. You will need to submit your portfolio as a single file, in either Microsoft Word or PDF format.

The link will become visible closer to the submission deadline.

Do not make the mistake of assuming that, because you cannot see the relationship between a reading or exercise that you are asked to do now, that the reading or exercise is not essential to the development of knowledge and skills that are needed in the assessment. 

You will not have assessment tasks that test a given topic or task. You will have assessment tasks that test how well you understand and can apply the whole module (and which of course would be unreasonable for you to be able to understand properly now).

I will provide you some data tomorrow.
Brief comparison over the board (OTB) chess and online chess:
1) The idea is over the board chess is considered a cheap sport runs by FIDE (company). Whereas online chess is successful business runs by chess.com
2) The number of memberships: 450K in FIDE, more than 100 millions in chess.com
3) The speed of games: over the board games are classic control (5-6 hours each game), rapid (45 mins game), blitz (3 mins per game). Whereas, online games are all blitz. So audience find it fascinating to watch. 
4) Money reward: OTB chess: prize for the 1st place in most tournaments 20K USD max, wherease playing online you can earn 70K or more (without the necessity to travel to the tournaments)
5) Venue: Locations of the OTB tourmanets varies (players pays form his pocket for airtickets and hotel), whereas online chess - play from home.no extra expenses
6) Broadcasting: OTB chess - mostly first 20 boards are broadcasted on chess.24 website (which is owned by chess.com). Chess.com is broadcasting most its events on its own paltform chess.com
7) Huge drawback of online chess: cheating! There is no way you can prove that someone cheated and impose fines! (case of Magnus Carlsen vs Nieman Hans). Chess.com only restrict you temporality, that\'s all. Former world champion Kramnik has claimed that NIkamura cheates on chess.com
8.) OTB chess needs to change its marketing strategy by making its games quicker (omit standard time control entirely, too slow, too boring, noone wants to watch and to follow), start broadcasting on TV and online, use smart cameras during broadcasting to catch the facial expressions (like in martial art, boxing UFC), introduce unpredictability (like in football when you do not know who will catch the ball) by making pairings before the round and not after each game (otherwise you can prepare with enigne/ computer at home)

The title of the dissertation should be smth like these:
1. Over the board chess versus online chess: how a new markeitng strategy can boost over the board chess and transform it to professional sport
2. The elimination of determinants in over-the-board chess that prevents OTB to transform into proffesional sport

Please read the following instructions through carefully and thoroughly before you commence any writing in the dissertation. 


This is to do with the information Economics 

Dynamic information disclosure in markets 
This topic examines when and how firm managers should disclose information about the firm\'s value in competitive markets, including the timing of such disclosures and whether bad news should be released.

The topic about the dissertation is the dynamic information disclosure in the financial markets. The financial market we are speaking about in this case is probably more to do with the stock market in this case. The main paper that you would be looking at is this paper here Endogenous Information Flows and the Clustering of Announcements† 
By Viral V. Acharya, Peter DeMarzo, and Ilan Kremer* 

The main goal for the dissertation is to make a twist in the model, for example, all the models (including the one in the main paper about the dynamic information disclosure in the financial market) are assuming the investors and the managers are rational, but in reality, the investors and managers are not rational but they are irrational. The goal for this dissertation is if we would assume the managers are rational, and if we would assume the investors are not rational but with a behavioral bias for example it might be the over confidence in the investors, or the loss aversion or the herding (the one which might be most well studied in this field of the behavioral bias), feel free to borrow one of the models from the Journal of Finance or any business journals and utilize one of the models in those journals. 

Then the main goal is to go back to the main paper which is the endogenous information disclosure in the paper, and make a twist in the model, for example, how would the formulas and the calculations look like when you have the investors which are not rational and how would you react to this information. 


Please see the attached dissertation as the sample for the standard of work and the layout I am looking for in this piece of work. 

Please write the introduction, the literature review with all the past academic papers in this field, and what the most important aspect is the theoretical framework which have the setup of the model, the assumptions in this model, the propositions, the diagrams, the revised calculations, the numerical simulation, the diagrams, the robust and extensions, and with the reference list. 

The most important thing is the part starting from the theoretical framework, please see the file named example dissertation which is the final dissertation piece of work I am expecting. 

Please see the other files attached as I would call it as the thesis for your ideas into how you would be able to approach this dissertation. Please do not write it with chatGPT, I will use checking tools to check if it written by the chatGPT, and also how it reads feels like as well. 



Before I make any large orders for the entire dissertation, the task for now is write a 1000 words literature review which should cover the following: 


The basic components of a literature review include:
* a description of the publication;
* a summary of the publication\'s main points;
* a discussion of gaps in research;
* an evaluation of the publication\'s contribution to the topic.

Please do an excellent job as the dissertation in the file that is named with the example dissertation and please do the literature review up to that standard. If things work out well for the literature review, then we can discuss about the entire dissertation order. Please for each sentence in the literature review, I am expecting meaningful words and meaningful sentences and it should not be anything that is general or not being specific. 

For the literature review, please do a comprehensive analysis in terms of the past research in terms of what has been already conducted and most importantly, what area of research has not been conducted in this field and how shall I cover this gap throughout my research in the current field. In the last part of the literature review, I wish to have a section with a subtitle with the potential gaps currently in the dissertation, please list out three research directions in the potential gaps for the dissertation. 

I am looking for at least 50 academic references with the high-quality journals in this field. 

The three attachments are the main paper used for the dissertation, the academic phrasebank which would help in writing the literature review for the dissertation, and the final attachment which is the quality of the dissertation I am looking at. 

The most key fact is that please do not write anything else in order to make up facts for the dissertation but rather make use of every single word to write the literature review. The most important think is what are the current gaps and how am I going to tackle these issues currently in the gaps. This is a theoretical dissertation so try to focus with the theoretical framework for the dissertation. 

I have to emphasize the dissertation would be about the primary research so please do not fill in the information with a lot of secondary research materials. 

I must also emphasize I do not need an introduction for the literature review, just go straight into the main content for the literature review, and this entire dissertation is 10000 words, if we work well with the 1000 words literature review (when I see the quality of the work you are producing), then we may work further for the remaining of the dissertation. 

Please provide at least 50 high quality academic papers for references and this must seen throughout the entire dissertation. Out of the 50 academic papers, 25 of the academic papers has to be the journals in the Economics and the remaining 25 academic papers can be from the journals from the accounting or from the finance, or behavioral finance or anything. 


If you think this dissertation might work easier with the empirical dissertation rather than the theoretical dissertation, please find at least 3 solid empirical dissertation papers with the datasets or guidance of how to find the datasets. 


A direction of the research I am currently at and it might be helpful to you. A gap in the literature might be the case that if we have the firm managers to be rational and we have the market participants to be irrational (with the behavioral biases for example it might be with the overconfidence, or it might be with the herding or it could be any of the behavioural bias that is most studied), and we would study how does the information release would impact the stock prices and then the stock financing etc since in all the previous models we would assume all of the firm managers are rational and the market participants are rational (if this is correct from your research in the literature review). Feel free to raise anything if this is not correct or if this has been researched in the relevant field. 

Please list out at least or identify 3 gaps in the literature review that has not been studied in this field. 

Please find the attached the example dissertation, as this is the level of work for the dissertation I am looking for in this field, the pdf for the academic phrase bank pdf is the pdf I am looking at for the key terms and the phrases to be used for the dissertation writing, and the third paper is the main paper for the dissertation.

Here is what I have written so far: 
Cancer screening is an important aspect of preventive healthcare, aiming to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with colorectal, breast, and cervical cancers by facilitating early detection (Brouwers, 2011). Obstacles restricting accessibility to cancer screenings create unjust and preventable systematic disparities in cancer screening diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes between different social, economic, or demographic populations, further discouraging cancer screening attendance (NICE, 2023). Understanding the barriers that hinder individuals from engaging in these screenings, can guide healthcare professionals efforts to increase screening rates amongst their patients and mitigate health inequalities (Eleanor, 2019). 

Theoretical models offer valuable frameworks for understanding the barriers associated with cancer screening (Howell, 2013) with the health belief model being one of the earliest to prominently feature and assess the concept of perceived barriers to performing health behaviours (Becker at al., 1978; Tussing, 2005). According to the Health Belief Model, potential negative aspects of a specific health action, termed perceived barriers, serve as impediments to adopting recommended behaviours (Rosenstock, 1974). This model offers insight into the connection between fatalistic perceptions and the low uptake of cancer screening (Kedar, 2021). Individuals who hold fatalistic beliefs regarding cancer prevention exhibit an altered valuation of cancer screening as a preventative measure, often aligning with an ‘everything causes cancer’ mindset. Fatalist beliefs, promoting a sense of external locus of control (Straughan, 1998; Pill, 1987), induce a sense of resignation in individuals, diminishing their self-efficacy and motivation to participate in screening behaviours that could potentially prevent cancer incidence or mortality (Niederdeppe & Gurmankin, 2007). 

Recent research highlights that cancer fatalism is most prevalent among medically underserved individuals and those with limited knowledge of cancer (Powe, 2003). Consequently, cancer fatalism emerges as a significant barrier to the uptake of cancer screening, particularly impacting populations characterised by low health literacy and socioeconomic status, which fosters more fatalistic attitudes towards cancer (Fleary, 2019; Keller, 2021, G Van Hal, 2022). This is exacerbated by their financial circumstances, limiting their access to healthcare resources, educational opportunities, and awareness programs. The resulting socioeconomic disparities contribute significantly to a persistent gap in cancer screening participation, with marginalised individuals encountering heightened challenges in navigating the complex healthcare system. 

The evident socioeconomic disparities in cancer screening are evident in the higher prevalence of missed screenings among individuals with limited financial resources (Wardle et al., 2016). The lack of economic resources directly corresponds to reduced access to information about preventive healthcare, leading to delayed diagnoses and compromised health outcomes. This inequality disproportionately impacts disadvantaged communities, perpetuating a cycle of health disparities and hindering progress toward achieving health equity. 

Subsequent research indicates that these barriers significantly contribute to delayed or insufficient participation in cancer screening among sub-Saharan African immigrants, who are at an increased risk for the social determinates and logistical barriers of health that negatively affect their ability to seek care, creating ethnic disparities in health (Muriihi, 2013). Notably, Black African individuals exhibit the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for all cancers combined. Despite this heightened risk, they are less likely to participate in screening programmes, a trend attributed to lower levels of education, income, and knowledge about cancer—factors intricately linked to perceptions of cancer fatalism. 

A more in-depth exploration into the impact of ethnic inequalities within the previously mentioned barriers to cancer screening (Powe, 1994) elucidates the significant influence of societal and cultural factors. These factors contribute to the reinforcement of fatalistic attitudes and low socioeconomic status as pivotal deterrents to participation in cancer screening among sub-Saharan African immigrants. Their reported limited trust in healthcare systems, historical mistrust, and cultural stigma surrounding cancer collectively amplify anxiety, further impeding their engagement in screening initiatives (Bastani et al., 2010). This inequality reveals the imperative for tailored interventions aimed at modifying cancer fatalism through culturally relevant and cost-effective approaches (Powe, 2013). 

Recent research reveals that individuals harbouring fatalistic beliefs often experience increased levels of distress, negative emotions, and a diminished sense of well-being and quality of life, elucidating psychological barriers that further effect their capacity to make informed health choices (Ayala, 2023). Psychological barriers, in this context, encompass internal factors and mental obstacles that obstruct effective communication, comprehension, or behaviour. These barriers may manifest as cognitive or emotional limitations, taking the form of preconceived beliefs, biases, fears, or anxieties. Such constraints act as substantial deterrents, adversely affecting the assimilation of information in health contexts and influencing individuals’ willingness to engage in screening programs or adhere to recommended screening guidelines. 

A comprehensive meta-analysis conducted by Devarapalli et al. (2018) unveiled that psychological barriers including embarrassment and shyness (45.16%), contribute substantially to avoidance behaviours and reluctance in participating in screening programs (Consedine et al., 2011). Notably, other frequently reported psychological barriers to engaging in cancer screening encompass aversion to painful procedures (41.93%), fear of a cancer diagnosis (35.48%), and anxiety or fear (38.7%) associated with the screening process. The apprehension surrounding a potential cancer diagnosis or the prospect of undergoing invasive procedures often serves as a deterrent, discouraging individuals from actively participating in cancer screenings. Addressing these psychological barriers emerges as crucial for cultivating a positive attitude towards cancer prevention. 

Moreover, psychological distress linked to cancer screenings is more pronounced among women, who experience increased vulnerability to fear, embarrassment and unease during intimate cancer screening examinations, contributing to gender inequalities within this barrier. A cross-sectional study conducted by Hanson (2023) reinstates this phenomenon, as their examination of self-reported patient barriers and motivators for cancer screening indicated that being assigned female at birth was associated with increased emotional, insurance, and family concerns compared to patients assigned male at birth. Furthermore, in-depth qualitative systematic reviews highlight that women encounter various psychological barriers to cervical cancer screening, including common myths about cervical cancer, misconceptions about screening, a lack of spousal support for screening, cultural taboos regarding the gender of healthcare providers, and the stigmatisation of women with cervical cancer. These concerns serve as substantial deterrents, significantly influencing a woman’s decision to either engage in or avoid cancer screening altogether. Hence, there is a compelling suggestion that effectively mitigating these gender-specific challenges requires fostering a more inclusive approach to cancer screening.

Here is a model answer you may refer to for structure: Example questions and responses from 2019-20 – Developmental

A clinician wants advice on how to better assess anxiety in their adult autistic patients. They currently use the GAD-7. They would like to know how to best adapt this tool for their autistic patients. Provide the clinician with some recommendations on how to adapt this tool, referring to relevant research evidence. Ensure your summary is written for an intelligent non-expert.

Answer 2 

Approximately 40% of autistic people are diagnosed with anxiety, however it still remains unclear whether this is an accurate statistic; misdiagnosis is thought to be prevalent, due to the lack  of a suitable diagnostic tool for this particular population. It is debatable whether the current method of diagnosis (GAD-7), based on neurotypical people, is appropriate for those with autism (Nicolaidis et al, 2020). The GAD-7 could be adapted to account for the symptomatology of autism. 

Previous research has shown that due to the presence of autism-related characteristics, anxiety manifests differently in autistic individuals compared to neurotypical people (Kerns et al, 2014). For example, autistic individuals tend to be hypersensitive to their surroundings; this overload in sensory information creates an intolerable uncertainty in the individual. Anxiety stems from this, expressed as restricted and repetitive behaviours (Wigham et al, 2015). Hence, the underlying cause and display of anxiety is different from neurotypical individuals.  The GAD-7 is currently lacking items to depict and pick up on these autism-specific anxiety symptoms. Inclusion of an item such as ‘‘I worry about being in certain places that could be too loud or too bright”, could work towards the prevention of anxiety being underdiagnosed in autism.

Additionally, some symptoms of autism and anxiety seem to overlap. For example, the item ‘‘being so restless it’s hard to sit still” refers to neurotypical anxiety but could be mistaken for the motor control and repetitive behaviours known in autism.  Therefore, either the symptoms of anxiety are simply regarded as part of autism rather than signs of a co-occurring anxiety disorder when being assessed with GAD-7 or vice versa, leading to a misdiagnosis in both cases. Thus, GAD-7 could be adapted to decrease diagnostic overshadowing by removing any ambiguous  items, which may represent an overlapping symptom and replacing them with previously mentioned autism-specific anxiety items.
Multiple studies have already made these adaptations to standard anxiety assessments, incorporating items related to uncertainty and hypersensitivity and removing abstruse items. They tested the assessment and found it had higher content validity and an improved factor construct compared to the original assessment. Although these improvements increased diagnostic  accuracy, this study was conducted on children, therefore generalisability of its success to assessing adults may be limited (Den Houting et al, 2019) (Rodgers et al, 2016).

The inability of autistic individuals to self-report their anxiety symptoms, may also require further adjustment to the GAD-7. Autistic adults tend to ‘camouflage’ their symptoms as a social coping strategy or may be unable to label their emotions correctly. Addition of items that reveal this could disclose any bias in responses. GAS-7 items may also benefit from focusing on behaviours and actions that indirectly infer these feelings . 
Overall, GAD-7 requires refining of its items to suit the behaviour and cognition of autistic individuals. By doing so, the tool will be more sensitive and credible in identifying anxiety in those with autism.

1. Please amend at your best practices the missing formatting and structural issues in order to stick to the guidelines.
2. ⁠please remove the the exceeding words and add a conclusion chapter, the important that all the work stays at 15000 or lesser words. The conclusion length of the conclusion should be comprehensive with the length of the paper.  
3. ⁠the paper should not look edited by you but if you can make it comprehensive with the narrative of the paper and the way I am writing. Please I need an expert review as the paper should be ready to submit. 
4. ⁠I understand the missing table of content and bibliography. Please use the reference from the existing paper and I understand you should divide in primary and secondary so please make this adjustment accordingly with references on the existing works. Please make sure that the OSCOLA referencing is correct and comprehensive.









There are two things which needs to be taken care of.
1. If we engage an expert to review and edit your work then definitely whole would have to be thoroughly reviewed and edited where necessary and we call this service as editing and proofreading. For this service, half of the word count is considered as efforts. For instances your word count would be 15000 words for the dissertation, so the expert would charge 7500 words efforts for editing and proofreading.
2. Yes, we can understand your concern that tone, style and delivery of conclusion chapter should be according to previous work so there is consistency in the tone. We will ensure this and as far as length of conclusion chapter is considered then it should be about 2000 words to represent the dissertation as whole. So, 2000 words efforts would be required for this chapter.
3. All other changes such as TOC, structural changes, references issues and bibliography would be corrected complimentary. 
4. We will need module guidelines or your university\'s handbook so that we can cross-check if each and everything is aligned with your university\'s instructions.
5. So, in total 9500 words efforts are required to work according to all above discussion.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/In Progress - [LLM] Dissertation Draft -.docx\""]",758.1,75.81,682.29,,,,29/12/2023 1:58,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Description
MHRA Format, 3000 words, requires primary & secondary referencing. I pretty much need this essay written from scratch as the one attached is absolutely awful. I\'m in dire need of help.

Did the career of Pompey do more to stabilise or to weaken the Roman Republic?

I\'ve already written a rough essay draft (no where near finishing) I still need to delve into the fall of the republic. My argument is that although his military successes were great, he did more to weaken it through his partnership with Caesar. Ambitious figures like himself made the fall inevitable. Also Sulla\'s role - he could\'ve done more to stop him/rein him in.
C. Suetonius Tranquillus, The Life of Julius Caesar in The Lives of the Twelve Caesars


and more


I have attached my workings so far with the rough essay draft with all the footnotes etc.

I realised i\'ve strayed too much, not even talked about the fall yet, and am increasingly overwhelmed by how much I have left. I\'m in need of desperate help.

I need to shorten everything I\'ve done, write about 1000-1200 words on the breakdown of the first triumvirate and republic, and also go back and do another paragraph on Pompey\'s political achievements/errors, including the paragraph contents i\'ve already written and really neaten it up into a 3000 word essay.

Structure should be:


Intro - early life / rise to prominence

1 - Military Achievements and Stabilization

2 - Political achievements/errors

3 - Internal Strife and the Erosion of Republican Institutions (51-45 BC):

4 - First Triumvirate: Explain Pompey\'s alliance with Caesar and Crassus, its initial benefits for the Republic (e.g., land reforms), and the seeds of future discord.
Breakdown of the Triumvirate:
Caesar\'s Gallic wars: Discuss how Caesar\'s growing military authority and popularity threatened Pompey\'s position, leading to jealousy and suspicion.
Breach of agreement and civil war: Analyse the events leading to the outbreak of civil war in 49 BC, focusing on Pompey\'s miscalculations and the Senate\'s role in backing him against Caesar.
Decline of the Senate\'s authority:
Pompey\'s flight and defeat: Explain how Pompey\'s outdated tactics and underestimation of Caesar led to his defeat at Pharsalus, dealing a fatal blow to the Senate\'s military power.
Caesar\'s dictatorship and Pompey\'s assassination: Show how Caesar\'s victory marked the end of the Republic and the rise of a single ruler, highlighting Pompey\'s indirect contribution.


5 - Pompey\'s Legacy: Balancing Achievements and Consequences (44 BC-present):

Positive aspects:
Military genius: Acknowledge Pompey\'s undeniable military skill and his role in expanding Roman territory and influence.
Restorer of order: Recognize his contributions to resolving external threats like piracy and Mithridates\' wars, temporarily bringing stability to the Republic.
Champion of the Senate: Show how Pompey was initially seen as a defender of the traditional Republican order against Caesar\'s growing power.

(Subheading 1) A brief history of adult social care in Wales 
400 words -   
For this section. Please add to the text already started below 

Asylums in Wales played a significant role in providing care for individuals with mental health conditions before the introduction of modern social care services. These facilities were often the primary institutions for people with mental illnesses. They offered treatment, shelter, and support for those who required long-term care. However, over time, an asylum\'s propensity, towards poor living conditions, reports of abuse and increasing levels of overcrowding, saw a growing emphasis on community-based care and support, which ultimately led to the closure of many of these institutions in favour of more personalised and community-integrated care options. 

The introduction of key policies and legislation, such as the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 and the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014, significantly shaped the landscape of adult social care in Wales. These laws aimed to promote independent living, safeguard vulnerable individuals, and ensure the provision of high-quality care services throughout the country.

In recent years, there has been a growing focus on person-centred care and the integration of health and social care services. The Welsh Government has also emphasised the importance of promoting well-being and prevention, leading to a shift towards more holistic and community-based approaches to social care.



(Subheading 2) Understanding Reform in Adult Social Care Legislation in Wales 

ADD the following -: 
Explain the key drivers for the change in policy in Wales identified in Sustainable Social Services
 
•Explain the need for adult care law reform generally – Mention the
 (Law Commission report for all Adult Social Care) – Final report April 2011

Mention the role of the European Convention of Human Rights 1950 plays in social care for citizens in the UK and particularly Wales. UK legislation must be compatible with (ECHR) and local authorities must also act in a way that is compatible with (ECHR). What potential implication would be seen for citizens, if the UK, specifically Wales, were to remove themselves from the European Convention of Human Rights. 

Please add to the text already started below 

Adult social care in Wales has a rich history, seen to have evolved over many years. The fundamental development of social care services within Wales has been influenced by various social, political, and economic factors. Following the establishment of the National Assistance Act in 1948, which aimed to provide support for elderly and disabled individuals. Moreover, Wales began to develop its own social care system. Furthermore, eighty years later The Welsh Government have continued with their success, through gaining more legislative powers over social care through devolution from the UK government.

The introduction of key policies and legislation, such as the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 and the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014, significantly shaped the landscape of adult social care in Wales. These laws aimed to promote independent living, safeguard vulnerable individuals, and ensure the provision of high-quality care services throughout the country.

In recent years, there has been a growing focus on person-centred care and the integration of health and social care services. The Welsh Government has also emphasized the importance of promoting well-being and prevention, leading to a shift towards more holistic and community-based approaches to social care.

My psychology module developing brain requires me to write a research proposal.  On this module, you will be assessed on your ability to produce a research proposal. This 
requires you to draw on the knowledge that you acquire over the course of the module to 
develop a novel and rigorous experiment (or series of experiments) that explores an aspect of 
brain development that you believe to be particularly important. In doing so, you will show just 
how much you’ve achieved the module Learning Outcomes – you must:
(1) show a good understanding of your chosen neurodevelopmental stage(s)
(2) critically evaluate existing evidence to show the novelty of your experiment(s) and 
how it will advance our understanding of both typical and atypical brain 
development
(3) demonstrate a critical understanding of research methods to argue why your 
selected method is most appropriate.
. You will be assessed on the appropriateness of 
your chosen methodology given your hypotheses (rigour), and your ability to propose 
an experiment that will improve our understanding of typical and atypical brain 
development (novelty and importance). Although you’re proposing a hypothetical 
experiment, you should write the research proposal as though you are actually trying to 
get funds for it. Instead of writing hypothetically (e.g., “I would do choose technique A over 
technique B”), you should write as though the experiment you’re proposing will actually be 
conducted if it receives funding (e.g., “Technique A will be used instead of technique B”

Structure guidance
Rationale: This section is your chance to convince the research council about the importance 
of the proposed experiment. To do so, you need to explain (a) how it differs from/is better than 
existing developmental neuroscience research, (b) how the findings will improve our 
understanding of brain development and (c) the benefits of improving our understanding. This 
requires you to critically evaluate the research (500 words must be written in this section - i\'ve already written some which need to be improved.

Hypotheses: In this section, you should apply your knowledge to make predictions about what 
the proposed experiment will find. Although there is no right or wrong answer here, your 
hypotheses should be informed by what we know already. (200 words must be written in this section)

Methods: This section is where you to demonstrate the methodological rigour of your 
experiment. You should describe and fully justify (a) the sample of people on whom the 
experiment(s) will be performed, (b) the experimental design, (c) any experimental paradigms 
and (d) the behaviour and/or neuroscientific techniques that will be used. In this section, you 
should also demonstrate your awareness of any ethical issues arising from your proposed 
methodology and how you plan to overcome them. (500 words must be written in this section)

Impact: In this section, you should think about ways in which your research findings can be 
used to make a real-world difference. How can they be used by industry to improve products, 
or by healthcare services to improve people’s lives. (300 words must be written in this section)

References: In this section, you should provide APA-formatted references for all the 
citations you give throughout.

EXTRA REQUIREMENTS
Please start by looking at my mini extract proposal document and possible research idea draft. - My proposal idea isn\'t perfect at all and needs to be improved for accuracy and quality.
I would like you to develop and add onto the rationale i\'ve started to write and improve my research proposal overall to  look at the long term effects of psychostimulant drugs such as methylphenidate on the brain’s functional activity in children with ADHD aged 12 using FMRI compiled with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. (main idea to show novelty but do add other reasons for novelty if you can) The rationale should flow coherently to inform methods, hypothesis and again highlight novelty importance and impact on real world. Please make this look like undergrad style work so I don’t get flagged. Please refer to all the other attachments to further support you with writing this research proposal for me thanks so much for your help. I really hope paying for this service will get me a good grade, I’ve been so stressed and tired. 

Please make sure the standard of work covers what’s also mentioned in the psychology mark criteria to achieve 2;1 or higher.
 Please use the “research proposal template structure document to write. Please notes all the documents I\'ve sent are to just assist you. . Module content notes to help also are called DP week 8 and week 9.

Question 2. Word Count: 1600 
This is an essay question written in an appropriate academic style, concerning an assessment of the EU case law on race discrimination, focusing in particular on whether the CJEU is yet to utilise the full potential of Council Directive 2000/43/EC (Race Equality Directive).

You will need to set the background to the Race Equality Directive and related case law, to assess whether the CJEU is yet to utilise its full potential. You will have to assess the accuracy of the statement with reference to EU treaties and EU legislation and key judgments of the CJEU.

You are strongly encouraged to read Chapter 25 of the textbook Craig and de Búrca, 2020) , focusing in particular on Section 5(a) of that chapter. Reflect on EU anti-discrimination law in the area of race discrimination. It will convey a convincing and structured argument, supported by key cases. Sources will be accurately referenced.You are expected to engage in some independent research. You may want to draw on material outside this module as the question requires a wider understanding of European Union law and its legal framework.  OSCOLA & HARVARD referencing

I don\'t think it is good enough and could use some help/rewording. I have struggled on the word count and worry it has lost quality in response. Maybe it needs to be started again? 

Write a 1200-word essay in response to the following essay question.

Essay question: 

With reference to the following statement, critically discuss the extent to which the trust is used as a vehicle to help manage wealth.

\""Every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so as that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be. If he succeeds in ordering them so as to secure this result, then, however unappreciative the Commissioners of Inland Revenue or his fellow taxpayers may be of his ingenuity, he cannot be compelled to pay an increased tax.\"" 
Lord Tomlin in IRC v Duke of Westminster [1936] AC 1, p. 19

The essay task requires some explanation of the law, which is likely to be descriptive. You should also aim to go beyond mere description to include, where possible, critical discussion of the use of trusts as they apply within the context of the provided statement. At every stage of you must demonstrate the skills of an independent learner and researcher, which means not simply describing the ‘how’ of the law but also the ‘why’. You should ensure that your essay covers two or more sides of the issue and makes judgements about the merit of these opinions.

Marking criteria: 85-100%: An answer in this band will show an excellent understanding of the use of trusts for wealth preservation and management, with reference to relevant legal authority. There may be minor errors. It will make appropriate reference to relevant study materials, including two sources cited in the source list, to make an effective critical analysis of the place of trusts in the context of modern society.
It will advance a logical and convincing argument about the use of trusts to protect wealth, and is likely to be sustained throughout much of the essay. The writing style will be fluent and clear, with an effective introduction, main body and conclusion provided. Almost all sources will be accurately referenced in-text and in the reference list.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Trust Essay Question Answer.docx\""]",79.75,3.99,75.76,,,,05/01/2024 2:49,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Compare, contrast and critically evaluate the Mars Rover Missions, Curiosity and Perseverance. Scrutinise the project management approach taken in each of the projects and elicit their salient (positive or negative) features and relevant practices, analysing and explaining the impact these have had on the overall project delivery and/or subsequent operational performance. The outcome of such project evaluation and comparison is expected in terms of a recommended set of definite rules and practices for future projects in the same class and of the similar scope/budget (‘Best Practice’). The standpoint should be balanced, and the analysis well-written, generously complemented with suitable references to the relevant, contemporary project management literature as well as referring to personal experiences, observations and insights where appropriate.

The presented analysis should be based on appropriate and substantial research, which must be evidenced in the report. The report should be 2,500 words, including any exhibits, tables and figures, but excluding the reference list. All figures and tables should be consecutively numbered, and captions provided.

Notes from my proposal:

In comparing the project management aspects of the Mars Rover missions, Curiosity and Perseverance, we can observe the evolution and refinement of strategies and methodologies over time. This comparison reveals how NASA’s approach to managing these complex and high-stakes missions has adapted and improved, informed by lessons learned and technological advancements.

Project Management Methodologies:

Iterative and Agile Approaches:
Curiosity: The project management approach for Curiosity was groundbreaking at the time, incorporating elements of agility and iteration. However, it faced several challenges, including timeline delays and budget overruns, which are common in pioneering projects of this magnitude (Lambert et al., 2012).
Perseverance: Building upon Curiosity’s experiences, the Perseverance mission likely integrated a more refined agile and iterative approach. This adaptation might have included better-defined iterative cycles and more responsive change management processes, enabling more efficient handling of unforeseen challenges (Wilson, 2021).
Risk Management:

Learning from Previous Challenges:
Curiosity: Encountered multiple risks, including technical challenges and environmental uncertainties on Mars. The risk management strategies, while robust, were in some cases reactive rather than proactive (Launius, 2013).
Perseverance: Benefited from the hindsight of Curiosity’s challenges. This allowed for a more proactive risk management approach, anticipating and planning for potential technical and environmental issues based on prior experiences (Smith, 2020).
Stakeholder Management:

Evolving Stakeholder Dynamics:
Curiosity: Managed a diverse set of stakeholders, including scientists, engineers, and funding agencies. Effective communication and stakeholder involvement were key to its success, although there were learning curves in aligning diverse objectives and expectations (Jones, 2014).
Perseverance: Likely saw an enhancement in stakeholder management strategies. With the increasing involvement of international and commercial partners, the project demanded even more sophisticated coordination and communication mechanisms (Brown, 2021).
Cost Management:

Budgeting and Financial Planning:
Curiosity: Faced budget overruns due to its pioneering nature and unforeseen technical complexities. This necessitated mid-course budgetary adjustments and re-prioritizations (Turner, 2013).
Perseverance: Had the advantage of leveraging Curiosity’s financial lessons, leading to more accurate initial budgeting and contingency planning, thereby improving financial predictability and control (Edwards et al., 2021).
In conclusion, the project management aspects of the Curiosity and Perseverance missions reflect an iterative learning process within NASA. Each mission built upon the successes and challenges of its predecessors, leading to continual improvements in project management methodologies, risk management, stakeholder engagement, and cost management. This evolutionary process demonstrates the importance of adaptive learning and flexibility in managing complex, high-technology projects in dynamic and uncertain environments.

To provide preliminary analytical results comparing the Mars Rover Missions, Curiosity and Perseverance, we\'ll focus on several key areas of comparison. These include mission objectives, technology and instrumentation, project cost, timeline, and project management approaches.

Mission Objectives and Achievements:

Curiosity: Launched in 2011, its primary objective was to determine if Mars was ever habitable to microbial life. Curiosity made significant discoveries, including finding ancient organic molecules and current seasonal variations in methane levels.
Perseverance: Launched in 2020, it builds upon Curiosity’s findings, aiming to search for signs of ancient life and collect rock and soil samples for possible return to Earth. A notable addition is the Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, testing powered flight on another planet.
Technology and Instrumentation:

Curiosity: Equipped with instruments like the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) and the Chemistry and Camera complex (ChemCam).
Perseverance: Carries improved versions of Curiosity’s instruments and new tools like the SuperCam and MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment), which aims to produce oxygen from Mars’ carbon dioxide atmosphere.
Project Cost:

Curiosity: Had a total cost of about $2.5 billion.
Perseverance: Estimated to cost around $2.7 billion. This increase reflects advancements in technology and the added complexity of its mission objectives.
Timeline:

Curiosity: Experienced delays in development, leading to a launch two years later than initially planned.
Perseverance: Benefited from lessons learned during Curiosity\'s development, improving its project timeline adherence.
Project Management Approach:

Both missions likely employed iterative and agile methodologies, but Perseverance may have had more refined risk management and stakeholder engagement strategies, drawing from Curiosity’s experiences.
In summary, while both missions share similar overarching goals of Mars exploration, Perseverance represents an evolution in both technological sophistication and project management refinement, building upon the foundation laid by Curiosity. These preliminary findings suggest that lessons learned from Curiosity were effectively applied to improve various aspects of Perseverance, from technological innovation to project execution.

1) Redefining Responsibility: Corporate Climate Change Mitigation Obligations from the Milieudefensie v Shell Case
 Subject: Establishment of a duty of care for fossil Fuel producing companies in the Milieudefensie/Shell case
In the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) case the Court for the first time established the existence of a mitigating obligation for private companies when it comes to climate change, going beyond existing governmental climate mitigation policies. How must we understand this corporate duty of care, how did the court come to its conclusion and is it likely to withstand appeal? This blog post will evaluate the reasoning of the court in the Shell case and investigate its possible consequences for future climate litigation.



2)In the Urgenda case, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ordered the State to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020, compared to levels in 1990. This groundbreaking ruling holds tremendous potential as a catalyst for sustainable development. However, it also raises a critical issue regarding the separation of powers. Our objective is to explore the extent to which a court may legitimately exercise power over a state’s climate policy based on the idea of separation of powers in constitutional democracies

In the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) case the Court for the first time established the existence of a mitigating obligation for private companies when it comes to climate change, going beyond existing governmental climate mitigation policies. How must we understand this corporate duty of care, how did the court come to its conclusion and is it likely to withstand appeal? This blog post will evaluate the reasoning of the court in the Shell case and investigate its possible consequences for future climate litigation.



2)In the Urgenda case, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ordered the State to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020, compared to levels in 1990. This groundbreaking ruling holds tremendous potential as a catalyst for sustainable development. However, it also raises a critical issue regarding the separation of powers. Our objective is to explore the extent to which a court may legitimately exercise power over a state’s climate policy based on the idea of separation of powers in constitutional democracies

I rely on you to find a topic/case similar to these to get approval from the professor.




GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS: 

Europe and Climate Change 2023-24
Instructions Final Assessment: Legal Blog Post
For the final assessment of the Europe and Climate Change course you are asked to write a legal blog. The final assessment is worth 60% of your grade. Below you can find further instructions on writing a legal blog post. General information on blogging is taken from the Legal Skills Academy 2-Page Guide on Legal Blogging, which you are strongly encouraged to consult in addition to this document.
What is a legal blog post? 
A blog post is a short written piece designed to be placed on an online webpage. Blog posts are generally shorter than academic papers, and are increasingly used to comment on ongoing and new developments, with a more immediate and widespread reach. For legal scholars, the exercise of writing a blog post pushes you to think hard about the main message of your research in order to distil a key legal problem and formulate your own position in a succinct and accessible manner. This skill is valuable for your professional development, as blogging is increasingly used by academics and practitioners. 
Blog topic:
For this course, you are asked to write a blog analysing a further development of European climate protection law and/or climate liability cases. You may draw on the material discussed during the course. The topic of your blog must not be the same as that of your small-group presentation. It is recommended that you base your blog on a limited selection of legal sources, for example, one new climate case or one EU legislative proposal. 
There will be an opportunity to obtain feedback on your blog topic during week 5 of the course. You may submit your blog topic idea (maximum 1 paragraph / 100 words) through Blackboard by Tuesday 12 December at 10.00AM. The instructors will provide basic feedback on whether you are on the right track, while students remain responsible for further independent elaboration of their research in the blog.
Blog style and format:
The tone of your writing needs to be accessible for your blog audience. For this assignment we assume that your blog audience consists of the wider public interested in the exciting developments in EU climate protection law. This means that your tone will be less formal than in an academic paper, revealing your own opinions more directly. On the other hand, the tone is more formal than on personal social media (such as Instagram or Twitter).
The title of your blog is particularly important for hooking the audience. The title should be related to a clearly defined blog topic. Try to avoid unnecessary acronyms as your wide readership may not be as familiar as you are with the ins-and-outs of legal jargon. Relatedly, you should then also define all legal terms used in your blog for non-specialist readers.  
The blog must be filled in to the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard. In addition, you may wish to add a relevant visual to get the audience’s attention. Please ensure that the visual is appropriate and clearly related to your blog topic. Make sure that you have permission to use the image, i.e. that it is not subject to copyright restrictions. You will also need to acknowledge the source. Some suggested image databases can be found here: https://unsplash.com/  &  Flickr: Creative Commons.
Be sure to reference your sources throughout the blog. This should be done as a hyperlink for online sources, and a footnote for other sources. Links to further information may also be of interest for the reader. This may be included as a hyperlink or added separately at the end of the blog.
An example of a very good blog post written by a Utrecht University Renforce researcher can be found on Blackboard, and online here.
Publication of the blogs
The aim of this assignment is to develop a blog that can be published online. The course instructors are currently seeking an outlet for a selection of the best blogs. You may also wish to publish your blog through your own social media channels. We ask that you do this using the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard.
Formal requirements:
	Maximum word length: 1700 words. 
	References to sources: hyperlinks to online resources, and footnotes to other sources. Footnote formatting may be in a style of choice (e.g. OSCOLA, Harvard etc), but must be consistent. 
	Correct use of Utrecht University template (available on Blackboard).
	Submission: please submit your blog post through Blackboard by Tuesday 23 January at 14.00.

Blog style and format: The tone of your writing needs to be accessible for your blog audience. For this assignment we assume that your blog audience consists of the wider public interested in the exciting developments in EU climate protection law. This means that your tone will be less formal than in an academic paper, revealing your own opinions more directly. On the other hand, the tone is more formal than on personal social media (such as Instagram or Twitter). The title of your blog is particularly important for hooking the audience. The title should be related to a clearly defined blog topic. Try to avoid unnecessary acronyms as your wide readership may not be as familiar as you are with the ins-and-outs of legal jargon. Relatedly, you should then also define all legal terms used in your blog for non-specialist readers. The blog must be filled in to the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard. In addition, you may wish to add a relevant visual to get the audience’s attention. Please ensure that the visual is appropriate and clearly related to your blog topic. Make sure that you have permission to use the image, i.e. that it is not subject to copyright restrictions. You will also need to acknowledge the source. Some suggested image databases can be found here: https://unsplash.com/ & Flickr: Creative Commons. Be sure to reference your sources throughout the blog. This should be done as a hyperlink for online sources, and a footnote for other sources. Links to further information may also be of interest for the reader. This may be included as a hyperlink or added separately at the end of the blog. An example of a very good blog post written by a Utrecht University Renforce researcher can be found on Blackboard, and online here. Publication of the blogs The aim of this assignment is to develop a blog that can be published online. The course instructors are currently seeking an outlet for a selection of the best blogs. You may also wish to publish your blog through your own social media channels. We ask that you do this using the Utrecht University template provided on Blackboard. Formal requirements:  Maximum word length: 1700 words.  References to sources: hyperlinks to online resources, and footnotes to other sources. Footnote formatting may be in a style of choice (e.g. OSCOLA, Harvard etc), but must be consistent.  Correct use of Utrecht University template (available on Blackboard).  Submission: please submit your blog post through Blackboard by Tuesday 23 January at 14.00.

I want the topic to be a relevant European case and follow all the directions. below find two blog post topics that have already received approval, take them as inspiration: 


1) Redefining Responsibility: Corporate Climate Change Mitigation Obligations from the Milieudefensie v Shell Case Subject: Establishment of a duty of care for fossil Fuel producing companies in the Milieudefensie/Shell case In the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) case the Court for the first time established the existence of a mitigating obligation for private companies when it comes to climate change, going beyond existing governmental climate mitigation policies. How must we understand this corporate duty of care, how did the court come to its conclusion and is it likely to withstand appeal? This blog post will evaluate the reasoning of the court in the Shell case and investigate its possible consequences for future climate litigation. 



2)In the Urgenda case, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands ordered the State to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by 2020, compared to levels in 1990. This groundbreaking ruling holds tremendous potential as a catalyst for sustainable development. However, it also raises a critical issue regarding the separation of powers. Our objective is to explore the extent to which a court may legitimately exercise power over a state’s climate policy based on the idea of separation of powers in constitutional democracies I rely on you to find a topic/case similar to these to get approval from the professor. 


GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:

 Europe and Climate Change 2023-24 Instructions Final Assessment: Legal Blog Post For the final assessment of the Europe and Climate Change course you are asked to write a legal blog. The final assessment is worth 60% of your grade. Below you can find further instructions on writing a legal blog post. General information on blogging is taken from the Legal Skills Academy 2-Page Guide on Legal Blogging, which you are strongly encouraged to consult in addition to this document. What is a legal blog post? A blog post is a short written piece designed to be placed on an online webpage. Blog posts are generally shorter than academic papers, and are increasingly used to comment on ongoing and new developments, with a more immediate and widespread reach. For legal scholars, the exercise of writing a blog post pushes you to think hard about the main message of your research in order to distil a key legal problem and formulate your own position in a succinct and accessible manner. This skill is valuable for your professional development, as blogging is increasingly used by academics and practitioners. Blog topic: For this course, you are asked to write a blog analysing a further development of European climate protection law and/or climate liability cases. You may draw on the material discussed during the course. The topic of your blog must not be the same as that of your small-group presentation. It is recommended that you base your blog on a limited selection of legal sources, for example, one new climate case or one EU legislative proposal. There will be an opportunity to obtain feedback on your blog topic during week 5 of the course. You may submit your blog topic idea (maximum 1 paragraph / 100 words) through Blackboard by Tuesday 12 December at 10.00AM. The instructors will provide basic feedback on whether you are on the right track, while students remain responsible for further independent elaboration of their research in the blog. Blog style and format: The tone of your writing needs to be accessible for your blog audience.

The maximum number of words for this exam is supposed to be 3300. There are three questions in total that need to be addressed,I would recommend using 1100 words for each question respectively. Please use a size 12 font and 1.5 line spacing. Thank you.

All questions are supposed to be problem qusetions,which means that all answers should:
Focus entirely on the appropriate issues in the problem question
All significant issues should be dealt with
Demonstrate excellent knowledge/understanding
Describe relevant law accurately and at an appropriate level of
detail
Demonstrate excellent critical application. Develop legal
arguments on the contentious issues and engage in critical scrutiny of
those arguments
No footnoting is necessary,but you must still refer to the relevant source of law
Please use quotation marks for direct quotes if needed
Make an appropriate use of sources (first and secondary,e.g.cases,judicial opinions,academic views on the topic)


1. The first question relates to the internal(domestic sport law-national governing bodies) versus external handling (criminal courts) of sports related violence:

\'It is the cup final of the rugby league season in the Swansea district. Tensions are
running high, as the players of both sides are desperate to be crowned champions. The
match gets underway and two minutes into the game, Andy catches the ball and can
see the try line in front of him. As Andy is running towards the line for what looks like a
certain try Brian, an opposition player, runs at Andy and catches him with a swinging
arm, which sends Andy to the floor. Andy is unharmed, but furious at the foul challenge.
Andy springs to his feet and punches Brian in the face, which knocks Brian to the floor.
Whilst prone on the floor, Andy punches Brian in the face again. A fight ensues between
many of the incensed players. The referee eventually breaks up the fight and gives
Brian a yellow card for the foul play and gives Andy a red card for the violent reaction.
There is no doubt that Andy will need to be disciplined for such a violent outburst.\'

To do: Critically consider which is the best forum to discipline this act of violence. Focus on
the pros and cons of punishment via the internal mechanisms of sport and through the
criminal justice system. Provide illustrative examples throughout to explain your
reasoning.
Discuss:
-WHO IS BEST PLACED TO PUNISH THIS ACTS OF VIOLENCE?
-HOW DO THE GOVERNING BODIES OF SPORT DEAL WITH THIS
VIOLENCE?
-AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE(PROS AND CONS)
-DOES THE CRIMINAL LAW HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS CASE?
-TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD THE LAW INVOLVE ITSELF IN THIS
SPORTS VIOLENCE?
-IS IT IN THE PUBLIC INTERETS TO REGULATE SPORTS VIOLENCE
THROUGH THE CRIMINAL ROLE?
-IS RESORTING TO THE CRIMINAL LAW PROBLEMATIC?
-PROS AND CONS OF CRIMINAL INTERVENTION
-CASE EXAMPLES
-CRITICAL APPLICATION TO THE FACTS OF THE PROBLEM


2. The second question relates to the criminal law and the defence of consent

\'Consider the scenario in question one above. Andy is afraid that he is going to be
charged with a criminal offence as there has been a police investigation in relation to
the incident.\'

To do:Advise Andy as to which criminal offences he could be charged with and
critically consider how the law of implied consent will apply to his circumstances.

Discussing and critically applying R v Barnes to the facts of the scenario is essential in this answer.
Potential criminal offences: s.20,s.47 and s.18 Offences against the Persons Act 1861,s.39 Criminal Justice Act 1988, s.4 and s.5 Public Order Act 1986


3. And the third question concerns liability in negligence for concussion(This is a long question,apologies for the flood of text)

\'Carrie was a professional rugby union player with the Swansea Saracens. She had
played for them for four years. Medical experts have recently told Carrie that he must
retire from playing rugby, due to severe symptoms of concussion. Carrie feels very
bitter towards her club, as she believes that she could have played for many more
years had they handled her series of concussions effectively. She wants compensation
and believes that she should pursue an action for negligence. She has come to you for
legal advice. Carrie wants to know, whether she should pursue an action for negligence
and, if so; against whom should she take the action.\'
You ask Carrie for further details of her case. She explains the following:
\'She had played at the club for four years. She had suffered a few concussions in her
first season with them but had always seemingly recovered well from them. In March
2022, she was playing in a cup semi-final when she suffered a head collision with an
opposition player. She left the pitch for a head injury assessment, which took place in
the changing room. The coach sent a message down to the medics who were carrying
out the assessment, to ‘get Carrie back on the pitch ASAP’, as the team were losing by
two points and there were only 16 minutes left in the game. Carrie was the specialist
goal kicker. She was desperate to get back on to the pitch. She tells you that the medics
asked her a series of questions, which she answered as best she could. She said it
was all very vague. The medics declared her fit to return to the field of play. Before she
returned to the pitch, she was sick in the changing room. When Carrie made it back on
to the pitch, the referee came over to her and asked if she was OK. The referee had
said to her that she looked disorientated and slightly off balance. She remembers telling
the referee that she was fine. When the final whistle went, she thought that it was just
the half time whistle. Her teammate told her that they had just won the game.
The final was two weeks later. She continued to train with the team, but she did tell the
club doctor that she was getting frequent headaches and had trouble sleeping. She
was selected to play in the cup final but in the second minute of the final, she was
tackled, and she fell to the ground and hit her head. She thinks that she was
unconscious for a split second. She vaguely remembers hearing the referee saying to
another player that he thought that Carrie may have been knocked unconscious but
that she looked OK, so he signalled for play to continue. The club doctor told Carrie
after the game that he had asked the coach whether they should take Carrie off at that
point but that the coach said that they could not risk losing her. He was afraid that the
match might come down to a penalty and that Carrie was crucial to them winning. Carrie
was angry when she heard this. She explained to you that just after the start of the
second half, she suffered a heavy collision with another player and became
unconscious. She does not remember anything after that point. She was stretchered
off the pitch and taken to hospital. The hospital discharged her the following day. After
an extended period of rest, Carrie started back at training with the club. She was
however aware that her coordination was not right, and her memory was very poor.
She had to stop playing altogether. She said that she gets angry and irrational, suffers
constant headaches and nausea, and has terrible memory loss. She tells you that he
has now been advised to retire from rugby as the damage suffered from the successive
bouts of concussion has rendered it too dangerous for her to play.\'

To do: Advise Carrie
Analyse:
-WHO COULD POTENTIALLY BE LIABLE FOR CONCUSSIVE 
INJURY IN SPORT? 
-IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES? 
-WHY MIGHT THEY BE LIABLE? 
-APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF NEGLIGENCE 
-DUTY OF CARE/BREACH/CAUSATION 
-DIFFICULTIES IN ESTABLISHING LIABILITY 

Please adress every question individually and with a respective Introduction/Main Body/Conclusion structure. Although the introduction and conclusion elements can be brief. Using the IRAC method while addressing individual problems could also be useful: ISSUE/RULE/APPLICATION/CONCLUSION

I would recommend the book Sport Law (Third Edition)by Mark James in case it\'s available to you. Chapter 1,2 and 6 are incredibly useful.

I apologise for the large amount of work I request of you,but I\'m grateful for your efforts.

What do cases of Asia Pacific multinationals reveal about their strategies, corporate organization, and core capabilities, and how these factors have shaped their development and outcomes in global markets? Analyze the following multinationals: 
No introduction needed.
1.	Hitachi Technologies, OR Toyota Motor Corporation BUT not both (max. 550-700 words)
2.	SMBC, OR Mitsubishi Corporation BUT not both (max. 550-700 words)
3.	Samsung Electronics (max. 550-700 words)
4.	Huawei Technologies (max. 550-700 words)
The proposed structure is to deal with each of the four multinationals that you choose in turn, exploring strategy, organization and capabilities, and the dynamics between them in explaining the development and current situation of the case firms.

Assignment Advice
The assignment concentrates on specific multinational cases, and extra marks will be awarded for comparisons as a form of analysis in any of the sections (which must be brief and to the point). Favourable consideration will also be given to placing cases in their national, international or theoretical contexts, as explored during the module.
After each presentation made by a visiting executive from an Asia Pacific multinational or alternative lectures from faculty, summarize the key lessons you drew from the session in the form of a dated note or diary. You are strongly advised to write each entry for these multinationals during the course, following the appropriate lecture.
You can also ask questions after each of these sessions to gain further information. We will be discussing our corporate cases and assignment 2 in the weekly workshops held in the second half of the term. You should use the literature on international and Asia Pacific business, available on the Moodle website, to help provide deeper insights.

Analysis, Structure and Content

Overall Question. What is the whole question implying, and how do you provide a precise answer? What is your overall response, and then what analytical structure will you adopt to substantiate your stated view?

Strategy/Motivation and Location. When did the case/firm move towards FDI? Where did the investment go? Are there differences in FDI histories or patterns with other firms or industries? How and when did a firm become an MNE or TNC? Why did firms decide to become multinationals? What therefore was their strategy or motivation? Entry mode? Are differences in strategy and capabilities because of timing of FDI, because manufacturers are unlike services, or because multinationals come from different countries? Where did the FDI go, and which locational factors were important in shaping decisions? To what extent are choices and decisions related to existing FDI theories and approaches? Have selected firms, industries or nations been market, efficiency, resource or asset seeking? Are there different patterns in the timing, location, strategy and entry mode of multinationals from different nations?

Capabilities. How did MNEs, once they have decided to ‘multinational-ize’, succeed as multinationals? What O advantages, capabilities or resources did they possess to succeed, or what advantages, capabilities or resources did they need to acquire or develop when ‘multinational-izing’? Does the case fit the OLI or the LLL framework better?
(a)	Production and operations? Management of global production chains, or SCM?
(b)	R&D, innovation?
(c)	Brand, design, product, and marketing? Distribution networks or relations?
(d)	Management skills and experience? Human resource management skills, training?
(e)	Building external networks and client relations, in host economies, as in service industry?
(f)	Access to resources such as finance and capital? Or key supplies?

Management and organization. To what extent have strategic needs evolved after the act of FDI, and how is this related to management, organisation, levels of centralization, decentralization, or regionalization? Employment of expatriates v locals? Usefulness of FDI theories and approaches?

Last year, I did a year placement there and I have access to do interviews with the CEO, Head of Hr and head of business development.

The question I want to research is ‘How FinTech Caxton got impacted by Covid -19 in terms of product and human resource management?’

Covid allowed Caxton to become more digitalised, realise the potential of and expand its B2B sector. Caxton also transformed to hybrid working.

To survive during Covid, Caxton had to put up a significant number of redundancies. This was due to the loss of most of its revenue stream (B2C international payments).

I would use the interview with the Head of HR to focus on the impact of Covid in terms of human resource management (switching to hybrid working and redundancies)and the interview with the head of BD to focus on how Caxton survived the loss of its mainstream and how the focus shifted from B2C revenue to B2B revenue..

I would then like to interview the CEO after the initial two interviews and then expand on interesting points which could add insight.

I need the literature review to focus on secondary research which will help analyse and compare revenue impacts and human resource impacts on the FinTech sector due to covid to Caxton.

I have attached my deadlines below:
I want the introduction and the literature review to be done by the 29th of January. I will need research methodology to be done by 16th February. I will then send interview transcripts over to you by 4th March.  I will need analysis and conclusions to be done and full dissertation completed by 18th March.",,,,,,,,,,,,[],558,55.8,502.2,,,,12/01/2024 5:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Such a reaction can take the shape of a short critique or look at one particularly poignant aspect. Please treat the reaction paper like a very short essay. A reaction paper has a brief introduction, a brief conclusion, and a very focused research question that can be answered in 900 words. The aim of a reaction paper is to train concise and precise writing, so please do not label it ‘reaction paper’ but think of a question that you can answer in a short way that still enables you to give sufficient evidence. In this case, the question is the Multi-faceted Interpretation of Truth in the different testimonies of witnesses of the vents in the film.

The attached file sets out a summary of the case you are presiding. Consider the submission of the legal representatives and decide what your judgment would be for this case. In your judgment, you should explore Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Directive 2000/78 and determine whether the survivor’s benefits apply to the circumstances of the case scenario, explaining the reasons behind your decision.
*Your judgment should be no more than 200 words*
Referencing as appropriate

*Background notes:
The facts of the case you will explore as a judge is similar to that in Tadao Maruko v Versorgungsanstalt der deutschen Bühnen.  In that case, Maruko had been living in a legally recognised partnership with his partner for four years when his partner died. Maruko’s application for a widower’s pension was rejected because this pension was not aimed at surviving partners in a legally recognised partnership.

The CJEU ruled that despite the legislation on marital status being entirely a matter of national law, benefits relating to those statuses were not. Essential to the Court’s judgment is the following statement:

If the referring court decides that surviving spouses and surviving life partners are in a comparable situation so far as concerns that survivor’s benefit, legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings must, as a consequence, be considered to constitute direct discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2(2)(a) of Directive 2000/78.

In your judgment, you should explore Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Directive 2000/78 and determine whether the survivor’s benefits apply to the circumstances of the case scenario, explaining the reasons behind your decision.*",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Anti-discrimination law.pdf\""]",15.95,0.8,15.15,,,,14/01/2024 9:32,0000-00-00 00:00:00

We get 10% allowance so max 3300 words.

Its meant to be Level 7 critical writing standard. I am happy for any edits to be made / new references / new paragraphs etc. 

Assessment Task
A 3000-word essay that critically and analytically explores and discusses the essay title.  
Answering the above essay title and including the following elements below will allow you to demonstrate attainment of the module learning outcomes. 
Things to include:
•	The essay cannot be written well without a particular focus, because you cannot discuss all of nursing or all of mental health services in one essay. So, although it is not stated directly in the essay question you need to pick a focus. Our suggestion is to pick a particular focus such as 1:1 time, conducting a care planning meeting (perhaps including the work before and after it), or possibly a community nurse making a first visit.
•	The first part of the essay question asks you to explore nursing strategies and skills. This means that the reader/marker will expect to see paragraphs that are obviously about nursing strategies and skills. The second part tells you that these skills are things that can be used to prevent the dangers of reductionism. That means that the reader/marker will expect that each paragraph will move on to offer reasons to think that these skills could have the effect of countering reductionism. The final part of the question suggests that the reader/marker will also learn how these issues sit in contemporary mental health services. It will not be enough to write some paragraphs about skills, some about reductionism and some about services. This is because each paragraph must develop an answer to the question, and the question needs you to link the three together. A lot of students struggle to understand this and lose a lot of marks (their work ends up “too descriptive” and “unapplied”). If you are in doubt, ask!
•	In mental health services, reductionism is often biomedical, but it is not the only way that reductionism can occur: all simple and tidy approaches to mental health are contestable. When discussing reductionism ensure this is broader than just the biomedical.  
•	Create a conclusion that explores the answer to the essay title and demonstrates how the interface between risk, ethics, law and service-user perspectives establish how quality improvements are made in mental health care and personal practice.


 Key points to remember:
•	Your essay should draw upon the recommended reading for the module (essays with reference lists with very few of the major recommended texts are less likely to be successful), and further references are likely to be required.
•	Given that sociology offers us understandings of human experience that are about power, there ought to be an element of your essay that discusses ideas about injustice and what things a nurse can do about that. That will also help you to demonstrate some learning within learning outcome 4. 
•	In our experience, most student nurses lose a lot of marks for structure and organisation of their work. Refer to guidance on Moodle about good paragraph formation and using the technique of reverse outlining to help improve your work.

Assessment Task
A 3000-word essay that critically and analytically explores and discusses the essay title.  
Answering the above essay title and including the following elements below will allow you to demonstrate attainment of the module learning outcomes. 
Things to include:
•	The essay cannot be written well without a particular focus, because you cannot discuss all of nursing or all of mental health services in one essay. So, although it is not stated directly in the essay question you need to pick a focus. Our suggestion is to pick a particular focus such as 1:1 time, conducting a care planning meeting (perhaps including the work before and after it), or possibly a community nurse making a first visit.
•	The first part of the essay question asks you to explore nursing strategies and skills.

Outline & and critically appraise your plans for future development as a leader of health and care teams. 

ESSAY OUTLINE:
This module will require students to reflect on their role as a leader and manager within health and care teams. The focus will be upon being effective within the complexities of community settings. Students will explore the principles of effective leadership, management, group and organisational dynamics and culture and apply these to team working and decision-making. Students will reflect on their ability to lead and manage their own workload and responsibilities including time management, prioritisation and delegation. Students will also explore how to receive and utilise constructive feedback. Students will examine their own leadership potential and ability to guide, support and motivate individuals and interact confidently within the interdisciplinary team. They will also examine themselves as an effective role model to others. The roles, responsibilities and scope of practice of all members of the nursing and interdisciplinary team will be explored, including how to make best use of the contributions of others involved in providing care. Students will apply the principles of human factors, environmental factors and strength-based approaches when working in teams. The module will cover the principles of performance management and how to monitor and evaluate the quality of care delivered by others in the team, including carers.

Students will explore their emerging role as a supervisor of students in the delivery of nursing care, promoting reflection and providing constructive feedback, and evaluating and documenting performance in the Practice Assessment Document. Students will practice how to challenge and provide constructive feedback about care delivered by others in the team, and support them to identify and agree individual learning needs. The module will also examine team reflection activities to promote service improvement and how this contributes to organisational change.

Students will also develop their skills for lifelong learning and start to plan their early career development.

I\'ve received feedback - The introduction needs work - it\'s to long and the section up until Evaluation of Policy Implementation and Effectiveness is ok. The tutor liked the case study approach and the section covering the LMDM  and strategies discussion.  As the tutor has reviewed the essay I would be grateful if you could keep the section related to the strategy discussion and enhance it if you feel that would add value. 

The essay needs to look at overcoming barriers in relation to patient access, service provision, the workforce and planning for the future and seamless care provision, social services with link to patient with MND. 


I\'ve attached some files that may be of help.

Please also review references both in body of essay, as some may not be in context and also in reference list to ensure they are properly formatted.


I am sooo grateful for your help with this as I\'m really knackered.

This study explores the benefits of job shadowing for further professional education, focusing on its impact on skill development and career progression. Using a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews, we analyzed the experiences of 64 professionals from several industries who took part in job shadowing. Our findings indicate that job shadowing significantly enhances practical skills, fosters an in-depth understanding of various professional roles, and assists individuals in making well-informed career decisions. Participants reported improved confidence and a wider professional connection (network) after participating in job shadowing. Nevertheless, various challenges were identified, including limited job shadowing opportunities, the inadequate understanding of some employees towards the concept of job shadowing, and a lack of structured program design. The study suggests that when effectively implemented, job shadowing can be a powerful method for professional development, offering hands-on learning and networking opportunities. 
We also explore recommendations for enhancing job shadowing programs in corporate environments, maximizing their impact and accessibility.

Using one of the examples below as a case study, critically analyse the factors affecting an airline’s decision to join an alliance and enter into a cross-border merger with the other airline, or acquire the other airline as an acquisition (note: some are mergers and some are acquisitions – your report should clarify which business activity took place). You should also include evaluation of a non-aligned carrier to act as a comparator.

Case Study Topic: British Airways – Iberia

Your answer should identify the factors that need to be considered in either regard, and be supported by evidence and examples drawn from a wide range of sources. The characteristics of each business activity should be analysed, focusing on the advantages/benefits and disadvantages/drawbacks and why the airlines may favour one approach over the other. Note, some of the airlines in the list have undergone cross-border merger activity, whereas others have embarked on acquisition of the other.

This assignment has been designed to provide you with an opportunity to demonstrate your achievement of the following module learning outcomes:

I think this lit review could do with a bit of restructuring and amalgation of sections – see below.

I have also left some in-text comments regarding your use of references as in some places less and more depth is better (your references are fine, though I only got the in text ones I think?) 

You say you’ll use Sinclair as your main theoretical definition on compassion but you don’t elaborate on it much, instead elaborating more on other definitions and frameworks such as Gilbert – that maybe needs some thought and a re-prioritisation whether you choose a different overall definition/framework or whether you stick with Sinclair but go into more detail using it

You would benefit from stating at the beginning of the literature review and at the end of each section what you’re moving onto do/talk about next, outlining the overall structure of the literature review then working your way through it.

You would benefit from a bit more focus on your strategy for searches, why you used this strategy, what time period etc you were looking at (or if not time bound, why not), did you look at ‘grey’ literature etc too – basically as detailed as possible

Keep sections about mh legislation/policy/mh crisis together

It also aims to explore the potential anime can have as a therapeutic tool. In recent years, anime has gained a vast amount of popularity worldwide, and its potential impact on mental health and well-being remains an intriguing area of study. 
The research will examine how individuals use anime as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, trauma, grief, and other emotional struggles as well as how anime can cause these issues by impacting one’s mental health. I will explore the ways in which the characters, themes and narratives provide a sense of emotional support as well allowing for the release of negative emotions and providing relief. This study will delve into the concept of “anime therapy” and how watching anime can also be used as a sufficient tool for managing and understanding one’s emotions. 
This study will also investigate potential therapeutic benefit of anime in the field of clinical psychology, such as using it in art therapy or narrative therapy. It will explore how Mental Health Professionals might use anime-related media in therapeutic situations to help clients with emotional regulation and self-expression.
My study will involve sending a questionnaire to participants pre interview  having them fill this out. I will then conduct interviews  focused on participants personal experiences of stress, anxiety and how anime affects this and how they use it to cope This will follow the semi structured scheduled  and will be expected to be around 25-50 minutes and then I will analyse the pre interview questionnaire using descriptive statistics and use a thematic analysis on the interviews (4 partipcants in total).

University tutors advised to not use websites as references and focus on following:
* The 10,000-word report should be a reflection of the research the student has conducted within the organisation they are working for.
*It needs to demonstrate the ability to identify a problem or issue that requires further research.  It should also demonstrate an understanding of the process of research and problem solving.
*Within the report, students should reflect on how well the theories used apply to the organisation. Leading to conclusions to how the problem/issue might be addressed by the organisation.
*The report needs to be written in an academic style, using appropriate academic literature to support the analysis.  For example, academic journal articles, industry reports, and practitioner publications.

Assessment 2 is an individual essay that requires students to discuss, evaluate and critically analyse the impact change has on people within an organisation (the BBC). Students are required to demonstrate their understanding of the impact of change within an organisation,(the BBC) and consider how people react in different ways to change, and how their reactions can impact on the process of change and the organisation itself.
Following this analysis, students are then required to debate the role of Change Agents within an organisation, (the BBC). As part of this analysis, students will want to discuss what a Change Agent is, their purpose and the role they undertake, and how they are perceived within an organisation – particularly if the change process is particularly challenging. Finally, students are expected to make a case for introducing Change Agents within an organisation (the BBC) with which they are familiar. Students are required to explain their reasons for introducing them within an organisation (the BBC),and discuss what they are seeking to achieve by doing so.

This essay requires students to underpin discussions and essay content with academic theory. At post-graduate level there is an expectation that the essay will have a clear structure, evidence of understanding, relevance and application, and originality.

Description and Brief
- You are welcome to select any theme / topic for research exploration as long as it is connected to digital transformation and is anchored in an organisational context.
- This can be inspired by one of the themes explored in the previous modules (eg information systems management, information systems failures, information security, disruptive technologies and their business potential – eg blockchain, digital strategy, information management / visualisation, digital customer approaches, etc).
- Typically, a research dissertation would require empirical data from an organisation (this could be the company that you are working for, have collaborated with in the past, or another organisation altogether). Alternatives would be provided in the dissertation structure if a student is not in a position to use a company for empirical data collection (eg a theoretical research alternative can be conducted).
- You will be asked to develop a brief of your proposal and a diagram portraying the research process that you intend to follow. This will then be discussed with your supervisor during the supervisory process.

I have provided briefs for each part and the steps and deadlines are below.

Ideally, I would like this dissertation linked back to the life sciences/pharmaceutical industry. There\'s a lot of data and studies on digital disruption and transformation. Veeva Systems can also provide me with Pulse data (digital engagement data). Open to feedback if it is not possible. 

Part A1 - Research Proposal and Plan (1,000 words, template provided) - due 19th February 2024

Part A2 - Diagram and Summary (1,000 words, example template provided) - due 19th March 2024

Part B - Research Oriented Dissertation (10,000 Words) - due 1st September 2024

I would like Callum to complete the second stage of the coursework.
A  brief reminder of the case
Steven Jones, a 58-year-old Estates worker at the University of Cwymfelin, suffered an accident at work in September 2023, resulting in an injury to his right wrist and eight weeks of absence. The accident occurred when Jones fell down concrete slab steps at the back of the Engineering Department Building, known as the G Block or Griffiths Building. He was carrying cardboard containers to be dumped in a skip. The construction work was ongoing, and the access to the back car park was blocked. Jones was instructed by his line manager to move the cardboard to the back of the building, but the lift was out of order that day. He was taken to Cwmfelin Hospital Accident and Emergency, where he was treated by Dr. Khan. He was discharged into the care of Mr. Peter Williams in outpatients and has to visit him every eight weeks. The incident occurred in a dark and rainy environment, with the lights on the wall not being repaired since last July.

 The aim of this study is to determine how vitamin D levels are different between those three eggs. A variety of factors can affect the results, such as the weather at the time the chicken laid eggs. In addition, the timing of feeding, the type of chicken food..... and many other factors. 

The results showed that vitamin D2 and D3 levels in caged eggs were very close to those in pure organic eggs. This experiment needs to be repeated a few times and may take place at a different time of year. It is also possible to visit farmers and collect information as well as analyze the daily lives of chickens and collect their eggs for analysis.

Porter’s Five Competitive Forces that shape Strategy: 

Threat of new entrants
e.g., barriers to entry (economies of scale, product differentiation, capital requirements, switching costs, access to distribution channels, cost disadvantages independent of scale, Government policy); expected retaliation
Bargaining power of suppliers
Bargaining power of buyers
Threat of substitute products
Rivalry among competitors (intensity)
e.g., numerous or equally balanced competitors; slow industry growth; high fixed costs or storage costs, lack of differentiation or low switching costs; high strategic stakes; high exit barriers.
What drives the competitor – its future objectives

What the competitor is doing – its current strategy

What the competitor believes about the industry – its assumptions

What the competitor’s capabilities are – its strengths and weaknesses

Collected data and information equals “competitor intelligence”

Pay attention to complementors – related firms selling complementary goods or services as these add value
All is fair in business…Do you agree? 

Industry associations often have ethical guidelines to follow when gathering competitor intelligence
Legal and ethical practices include:
obtaining publicly available information
attending trade fairs/shows/exhibitions
Unethical and/or illegal practices include:
blackmail, trespass, eavesdropping, theft
Internal analysis helps firms identify strengths & weaknesses and prompts strategic action
Analysis of “four criteria” helps 	determine the extent of competitive advantage and its sustainability
Value Chain analysis identifies which parts of the organisation create value and which do not 
SWOT
How can the organisation use it strengths to take advantage of opportunities?

How can the organisation use its strengths to reduce the impact of threats?

What weaknesses are preventing the organisation from taking advantage of opportunities?

What weaknesses make the organisation vulnerable to threats?
Benefits of Resource Integration
Benefits:
value creating cooperation between parties with complementary products
innovative bundling and leveraging of resources & capabilities

Barriers:
-  focusing on the environment or core competences can mean firms fail to see ways of using highly complementary assets – core rigidities
Cost leadership strategy, HR examples:
outsource manufacturing to a country with low cost employees
initiatives to reduce turnover
training courses that focus on developing efficiency

Differentiation strategy, HR examples:
rewards that promote creativity and productivity
training programme that educates about differentiating features 

Resources & capabilities can be sources of competitive advantage (must be valuable, rare, costly to imitate, and non-substitutable to sustain competitive advantage)
Value chain analysis helps identify opportunities for creating value 
Strategic bundles of resources & capabilities can lie outside a firm’s boundaries (i.e., external resources)
Internal resources can be combined with complementary external resources to enhance competitiveness
Open innovation can increase the range of resources available for value creation
The information from analysis of the external environment, analysis of internal competencies, and identification of useful external resources informs business strategy
Formal process that connects business strategy to human resource strategy and practices.

Ensures that a company has the right people in the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost.

Ways in which strategic workforce planning delivers value
Uncovers significant differences among business units or locations (HR Analytics ensures that). Production, engagement etc.
Provides metrics and other tools to support business decisions
Enables leaders to compare the long-term implications of alternative business scenarios and HR options
Supports types of planning at different levels of the organization
What are the “main” job requirements of the GM position?

Which requirements/criteria are critical?

Which requirements/criteria can be compromised?
Validity: Degree to which the inferences decision makers make about job performance from predictor measures are accurate
Degree to which the evidence supports inferences that are drawn from scores or ratings on a selection procedure
Inferences regarding the specific use of a selection procedure are validated, not the procedure itself 

Quantitative evidence of validity is expressed in terms of a correlation coefficient between scores on a predictor of job performance and a criterion that reflects actual job performance 
In employment contexts, predictor validities typically vary between about 0.20 and 0.50 
Goal is to identify applicants who score high on measures that purport to assess knowledge, skills, abilities, or other characteristics that are critical for job performance 

Types of selection errors that could occur
Erroneous acceptance: Selecting someone who should be rejected
Erroneous 

61% of new hires are unhappy because they feel that they had been misled during the hiring process (Harris Interactive, 2013).
50% of hiring organizations or the new hires themselves regret the decisions they made (The Recruiting Roundtable, 2013).
46% of new hires fail within 18 months (Leadership Quarterly, 2013).
90% of executives said retaining new hires is an issue with turnover rates of 10-25% within the first 6 months alone (Korn Ferry, 2014).
66% of Millennial expect to leave their organization by 2020 (Deloitte, 2016).
Informal contacts are used widely and effectively at all occupational levels
Use of public employment services declines as required skills levels increase
Internal market is a major recruitment source except for entry-level, unskilled, and semiskilled workers
Larger firms are the most frequent users of walk-ins, write-ins, and the internal market
There is no consistent relationship between recruitment sources and person-job fit
Use of multiple recruitment sources together with informal sources provides more realistic and accurate information
Talent agenda should be driven by the C E O
Common set of leadership attributes should be identified and communicated to serve as a road map
Comprehensive performance reviews should be used as the building block for assessment, development, and management consensus about performance.
Regular schedule should be kept for performance reviews, broader talent reviews outside one’s functional area, and the identification of talent pools 
All decisions about talent should be linked to the strategy of the organization

GUIDANCE
This guidance is not designed to be prescriptive, or to limit how you approach the task, but rather to provide some guidance on how you might meet the learning outcomes, and how you might approach the general structure of your written work.  A reminder of the outcomes:
1 demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the operation and fundamental principles of the law, and be able to explain and apply commercial law, including consumer and employment laws, as it affects company directors, entrepreneurs, managers, and stakeholders;
2 critically evaluate the legal frameworks within which businesses operate;
3 demonstrate skills of critical analysis of the law, including logical application of law to the solution of legal problems likely to be encountered by businesses;
4 demonstrate an ability to identify and use legal materials, including some primary sources.
INTRODUCTION
In your introduction, provide a clear indication of what you will cover and how you will structure your response. You might say what the specific areas of law that you will cover.  
MAIN DISCUSSION
In this section, which may be derived into an appropriate number of paragraphs, you should work through the scenario and carefully discuss any legal issues/liabilities or potential for legal action which may arise from the events described.
Throughout your study, marks will be awarded if you:
•	show evidence of wider reading and research (relying on class materials will be insufficient)
•	make specific reference to relevantstatute and case law (the higher marks will be gained by again showing knowledge of examples beyond those introduced in the sessions - see if you can find additional case law to reference)
•	write clearly and articulately, showing that you fully understand the academic conventions. The Learning Hub will help you if you are at all unsure, but do not leave it until the last minute to seek support!
CONCLUSION
You will need a short and focussed conclusion.  

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
With a case study scenario remember the following:
a)	based on a factual scenario that could happen in real life
b)	demonstrate your understanding of a particular area or areas of law and apply them in a practical way to the problem. So, look at the issue and see what law/legal principle applies and use your knowledge of case law or statute to show the authority for that law or legal principle
c)	work through all of the relevant legal issues but remember not all of the issues will require in depth analysis.  Sometimes the issue may seem trivial but look at it and if it doesn’t need exploring in detail you may need to explain why
d)	reach a conclusion, although you may have a number of mini conclusions after dealing with each issue.  Remember in law you need to argue both sides of a case and argue the likely success of those cases. 
REFERENCE LIST
You will need to provide a fully referenced list of all sources which you have cited, or from which you have quoted, in your essay - see the LTU library guidance on referencing and or contact library staff for more information.

RESIT ASSESSMENT: THE CASE STUDY
SUBMISSION BY 18MARCH 2024
Rationale
This is the first part of your module assessment for this module and is based on the case study (see below).The study will allow you to demonstrate your understanding of relevant statute and case law, and your ability to identify, apply and evaluate legal argument to a business-relatedcontext.You are not expected to demonstrate the full range of skills and knowledge that would be expected of a student of law, but rather those of a manager when dealing with a potentially litigious situation.
Task
To research and write 2,000words on the case studywhich tacklesall the potential legal issues arising from the scenario, drawing particularly on your knowledge of common lawnegligence.In identifying the legal issues, you will also need to set out what the respective parties’ claims are (if they have any).
The Case Study
You work for SpeedMovers Ltd (‘SpeedMovers’) as a compliance officer with a degree in business.  SpeedMovers is asmall private company that provides speedboat rides to tourists visiting Sunny Town.Mike,also works for SpeedMovers,and has just finished histraining course as a ‘skipper’ (a driver of a speedboat).  Mike took Nigel, a visitor, for a ride in one of the company’s speedboats.  However, Mike forgot aspects of his safety training, and drove the boat at high speed, well in excess of the speed limit for such waters.  Eventually Mike lost control of the boat and nearly collided with Osman who was swimming, whilst Nigel was badly injured after being thrown into the sea.Nigel’s injuries were made worse by his allergy to salt water.  
Shortly afterwards, Phil, Nigel’s long-time partner, walked down to the beach.  Phil soon recognised the boat and then witnessed blood and gore, so he ran to the local hospital and found Nigel in severe pain and distress.  Osman and Phil have suffered mental distress from their experiencesduring the day.
Discuss the rights and remedies of Nigel, Osman, and Phil against Mike andSpeedMovers Ltd.

Specify the relationship between Mikes’s the boat operator and Nigel who was a passenger and Osman who were swimming proximity by the accident. 
Nigel and Osman are the claimant , and Mike is defendant .Furthermore, it is crucial to ascertain to identify the primary and the secondary victims and elucidate the reasons behind their classification. By linking the similar law case of Adcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire [1992] 1 AC 310 and explanation will be provided to justify why Speed Movers Ltd bears liability for Phil\'s experience of mental distress and psychological harm by linking it to McLoughlin v O\'Brian.
And additionally anglicising the comprehensive and the potential claim against Mike and Speed Movers Ltd. Daish v Wauton, 15 October 1971

At the time of the accident, Mike was working as the skipper of Speed Movers Ltd. Speed Movers Ltd may be vicariously liable for any injuries toward Nigel and Osman. As a result of employer conduct; as Mike the operator was negligent in failing to adhere to the safety procedure and then lost control of the boat, Nigel who was thrown into the sea and suffered a serious physical injury and boat almost colliding with Osman who was swimming nearby.
And that conduct he has caused physical harm of a permanent and quite serious kind to Nigel who was thrown into the sea and suffered a serious physical injury and psychological harm and mental distress to Osman and Speed Movers Ltd owed a duty of care to their claimants. This can be seen in the Century Insurance v NI Road Transport Board [1942] AC 509. A driver employed by the defendant company was involved in transporting petrol, to be transferred from his lorry to a storage tank at the delivery point. Throughout this process, the employee lit his cigarette, flicked the match to the ground, and caused an explosion. The defendant was found vicariously liable for this conduct. Although the employee’s conduct was plainly negligent, he was nevertheless engaged in the execution of an authorised act.
There is no evidence that Speed Movers Ltd actually caused the harm, however the Speed Movers Ltd is still liable for its employee’s actions. Moreover, vicarious liability is based on the principle that employers should bear responsibility for the conduct that they have caused this is where the vicarious liability comes in. Essentially, vicarious liability requires a defendant to be liable for the actions of a third party acting on its behalf and within the course of its employment. The most crucial circumstance in which this concept will occur is where the individual was acting on behalf of an employer. 
Secondly, because vicarious liability tends to have the effect of targeting employers and business owners, imputing vicarious liability provides that liability can be attributed to those who can best bear the costs of litigation. 
And Court found that the truck driver’s volition – he acted carelessly, but he acted with the intention of delivering the petrol into the tank of the vehicle, as a part of his employment. The common law has since dispensed with the requirement that the act has to be done for the benefit for the employer the employee was negligent in his discharge of his duties in smoking as he did, yet it was for the purpose of discharging his duties for his employer and, so, the employer was liable for the negligent act. NI Road Transport Board was held vicariously liable for the damage caused to the innocent bystander by its employee’s negligence.
To succeed on a claim in negligence, or for breach of a standard of care imposed by statute, a claimant has to establish that there was: (i) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the claimant; and (ii) the defendant’s breach of that duty; and (iii) the claimant’s loss or injury arose from the defendant’s breach
Primary and secondary victim
 A primary victim is one who suffers psychiatric injury, on account of the accident, either because he (Nigel) is himself directly physically injured or because he is placed in a state of apprehension about injury. A person who is directly injured through a defendant’s negligence can recover damages not only for the injuries experienced but also for the psychiatric damage. The principle that one who negligently places another in a state of apprehension about injury will be liable to that person for any damage was established. By looking at White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire. C (Alcock) and others brought an action against the Senior officer of the South Yorkshire Police, alleging that they had suffered nervous shock as a result of having witnessed the death of friends or relatives, who were caught up in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, in which 95 supporters of Liverpool FC died of asphyxia, at a football match at Hillsborough stadium, after the Police did not control the number of supporters allowed to assemble in a particular part of the stadium resulting in a fatal crush. The disaster was broadcast live on television – some claimants claimed to have witnessed deaths. 
The case law constructed a series of rules for different claimant categories being injured by events through shock. The categories vary at different stages of the law, but after the case of Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and White v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (1992) there are now three categories: 1. Those who suffer physical injuries caused by the defendant’s conduct and psychiatric injury as a result (primary victims) 2. Those who are put in danger of physical harm but actually only suffer psychiatric injury (what I call primary victims). 3. Non-primary victims (eg, those who do not face risk of physical injury but suffer only psychiatric injury from witnessing other lawful harms, such as death, disfigurement or severe injury like Osman who was swimming nearby.
Secondary Victims Phil, Nigel’s long-term partner, might be a second victim entitled to bring a claim for emotional distress. Emotional distress refers to the mental suffering, an emotional response or a psychological harm suffered by a plaintiff as a result of witnessing their loved one in pain. Phil witnessed the impact of the accident, found Nigel in dreadful state and might entitled to claim for the emotional distress he might have suffered. They can suffer psychological illness claiming compensation. Among them there are sub categories of people who suffered with the psychiatric injury as a result of watching the death or injury of the friends caused by somebody else’s negligence. 
Compensation 
If a court is dealing with a claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty, it may in deciding whether a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would have taken precautions against a risk or contravened a relevant statutory provision.
(a) stop an activity that one would like to perform entirely, for a particular amount of time, or in a particular way, or 
(b) Discourage persons from undertaking functions in connection with a desirable activity.
According to The two House of Lords decisions that followed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Daish v Wauton case, but predating the enactment of section 5, were Pickett v British Rail Engineering Ltd [1980] AC 136, which concerned the assessment of earnings of the plaintiff over years lost to him (and, in sum, to his estate) in consequence of the injury of which he complained: should allowance be made for the basic living expenses he would have incurred had he lived?
 The House held that it should; and Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority [1980] AC 174, which concerned a catastrophically injured plaintiff whose expectation of life was not seriously shortened. She had large claims for loss of earnings and for the costs of future care. The House of Lords held that deductions must properly be made from the damages awarded to reflect the actual cost of earning the lost future income, and also the expenses of living which the injured party would have incurred in any event.
There is an argument for negligence since injuries and damages can be circumcised upon someone for a lack of benevolence towards others. Nigel is also a case with a valid argument why he is entitled to compensation .Compensation amounts to a lot of money as one can cover various accident-related aspects. Firstly, Nigel can make a claim for medical suffering which will cater for any of his medical costs, for instance, any costs incurred when he was admitted at the hospital, consultation and operation fees, drugs and medications and any medical related issues or treatment which he might need it in future as such cost are absorbed because they directly result from his injury. Secondly, he will lose his money in the short term since he will not be in a position to resume back to his job. He will be entitled to the claim any wage compensation during the term of his stay while on rehabilitation. It can affect his future earning capacity. Lastly Nigel has a right to claim for any pain and suffering caused by the accident. Since it could be physical and emotional pain or suffering as a result of the injuries that he has sustained, therefore, to which extent he has now experienced with the injuries and the way it has affected his day to day living is what the court will consider in paying such compensation. Other than that particular pain and suffering caused by the accident itself, there are other forms of pecuniary or non pecuniary losses. 
For example, in the well-known case of Century Insurance v NI Road Transport Board [1942] AC 509, an employee while on his way to deliver petrol exploded the van and escaped uninjured. He was clearly negligent. Nevertheless, his employer was held vicariously liable. In order to succeed in a claim based on negligence or breach of a statutory duty, it has to be shown that there exists a duty of care from the defendant to the claimant – that is; the defendant owed a certain degree of responsibility for the care or safety of the claimant. There also has to be a breach of that duty of care of the defendant; and loss or injury to the claimant that is caused by that breach. Here, Nigel, the passenger, sustained both bodily injury and psychiatric injury due to the accident, and since he is a primary victim, he can get compensation for both physical injury and psychiatric injury. His partner Phil may be able to make a claim as a secondary defendant, as he is a secondary victim of emotional distress. Although Osman was he too was subjected to lasting physical harm through the negligence of Mike and Speed Movers Ltd. Osman would be entitled to recover, among other things, the cost of the medical treatment, wage losses during the period of recuperation and pain and suffering due to the accident. Whether Nigel and Osman will succeed in their claims depends on a range of proofs, including showing that Speed Movers Ltd owed a duty of care to them.

You will present your work as a dissertation. It should be close to but no more than 6000 words. Anything over 6000 words will not be read.  The dissertation has a structure which reflects the review and summary of a body of literature relating to the particular topic you have chosen. There is a suggested word count for each section (see page 14). It is up to you to choose appropriate headings for chapters or clear sections of the work. A front sheet is required which should contain thefollowing information; module title and code,  title of the dissertation, a declaration that this is your own work and the word count, not including reference list or appendices.  Following the front sheet there will be a contents page. No student identification should be included.

Guidance on structure of dissertation
Dissertations normally include an abstract (similar to that required for journal articles). This is a short précis of the work undertaken, key findings and recommendations. 
The beginning
The dissertation begins with an introduction to the topic, the nature of the problem, any relevant context and background such as policy or practice issues that relate to the topic. There should be a clear rationale for the choice of topic. You will find it helpful to set a clear aim or aims at this point and possibly some objectives relating to that aim.  This section should convince the reader that the review is important, worth doing and will contribute in some way to practice.
The methods section covers details of the search strategy and results, types of literature available and relevance to the topic, hierarchy of evidence, and selection of literature for review.  This section should acknowledge different research methodologies and their relevance to the topic.
The number of papers you review is ultimately a decision you need to make and will reflect the amount of work that is published on your particular topic or question. For guidance it is not recommended that you use less than 6articles and it will be difficult to do justice to more than 10.  You should include primary research papers in the overall number of articles found for review. The remainder of your reference literature can include other types of review eg literature review, systematic review, practice based articles, discussion papers, concept analyses, policy documents etcetera.
The main body
The review section is the major part of the work and amounts to just over half the word count. This section is broken down into critical appraisal of the literature and application to clinical practice. In order to write this section you will have done a considerable amount of work on the papers you have gathered so that you are fully aware of their strengths, weaknesses and what they contribute to the knowledge base around your chosen topic.  You may find it helpful to theme the literature in some way. You will need to work out how to structure this section carefully; which papers should you review first?  Should you discuss similar research designs together? These are aspects you will need to discuss with your supervisor. 
This section should include a summary of the findings of the review. Even if the papers chosen are diverse in their methods, a summary of the overall findings is required and some attempt made to link the findings.
Recommendations and Conclusion
The final section will include a summary of your work and include thoughts for future work or how your knew knowledge can be translated or support your clinical practice. What are the implications for further research, for education, and importantly for practice?  As part of this sectionyou should include if you haven’t already discussed it, the implications for patient and/or carer experience where relevant.
You will make some recommendations for practice, and in order to do this you will need to consider your initial aim and objectives when you set out to investigate the topic.
References and Appendices
The reference list should be fully comprehensive and accurately reflect the cited sources within your text. 
Mandatory Appendix1- You must include a table of the papers used for the review. This table will include basic author, title, date information plus some additional basic summary data eg type of paper, research methods, and population studied/discussed. The exact titles you use will depend on your topic of choice.
Mandatory Appendix 2 - You must include a Prisma flow chart demonstrating your search strategy and results. 
Additional appendix - You cannot use the appendices to include information which is integral to the logic and comprehension of the main body of text.  However, sources that offer additional clarification or further information can be added here.   

Degree level criteria
This module and assessment focus on particular degree level skills such as
•	An ability to manage own learning, making use of scholarly reviews, primary sources, key documents in relation to nursing and healthcare

1.0 Introduction
Every year in the UK around 230,000 elective surgical procedures are carried out on patients with diabetes mellitus (Getting it Right First Time [GIRFT], 2021).  Patients with diabetes make up a disproportionatelyhigh number of those undergoing surgery (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death [NCEPOD], 2018), experience longer lengths of stay, higher rates of readmission and increased morbidity (Rayman & Kar, 2020).  Good preoperative glycaemic control has been demonstrated to improve surgical outcomes (Frisch et al, 2011) and the need for preoperative optimisation forms part of NHS guidance on perioperative care (Dhatariya et al, 2011).  Yet, despite this, the NCEPOD report (2018) found an absence of ownership and optimisation of diabetes in the preoperative period.

1.1	Aim
The aim of this literature review is to explore the evidence for interventions to improve preoperative control of diabetes in patients undergoing elective surgery.  It will be used to inform the work of a quality improvement project toimproveoutcomes for patients with diabeteswithin one NHS Trust.  Studies will be critically analysed to provide a greater understanding of the effect of interventionsonclinical outcome measures,and to establish whether a particular approach to preoperative glycaemic optimisation demonstrates greater efficacy.  It will also consider what barriers may exist to optimising glycaemic control in the preoperative period and how these may be overcome.
This review will consider studies of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes but will not include those with gestational diabetes for whom separate national guidance exists.

1.2	Background
It is estimated that by 2025 more than four million people in England will have diabetes (Diabetes UK, 2016).  The microvascular and macrovascular complications of this metabolic disorderincrease the need for surgicalprocedures (Dhatariya et al, 2011).  Dhatariya et al (2012) suggest people with diabetes currently make up a disproportionate 15% of those undergoing surgery.Furthermore, they are more likely to suffer postoperative cardiac and renal dysfunction, as well as pressure damage and infection (Dhatariya et al, 2011).  This not only results in an average increased length of stay of 3 days for patients with diabetes versus those without (GIRFT, 2020), but also a 50% higher mortality rate (Frisch, 2011).  
Successive studies have identified the risks of preoperative hyperglycaemia (Sampson et al, 2007, Frisch et al, 2012 & Yong et al, 2018).Current UK guidance suggests an HbA1c of less than 69mmol/Mol should be achieved preoperatively, and that all patients with diabetes should have their HbA1c checked within the 3 months prior to surgery (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [NICE], 2016).  However, successive reports (Perioperative Quality Improvement Programme [PQIP], 2019, NCEPOD, 2018 & Centre for Perioperative Care [CPOC], 2021) have suggested not enough is being done to achieve this target and highlight a lack of continuity of diabetes management across the whole perioperative pathway.   

1.3	Problem
The NCEPOD report (2018) was a retrospective study of 509 surgical patients with diabetes undertaken due to concerns of gaps between recommended and real-world practice.  It found two fifths of referrals to surgical centres contained no information about the patient’s diabetes management, and only 42% had their HbA1c checked in the 3 months prior to referral.  While CPOC (2021), a cross-organisational bodyset up to promote quality perioperative care, suggests only around one third go on to have their HbA1c checked at preoperative assessment.  These figures are supported by the findings of the PQIP annual report (2019) which stated that only 69% of patients in that study had their HbA1c checked during the preoperative period.  PQIP (2019) further suggests that within the timeframe of the elective surgical pathways there should have been time to optimise 90% of those with poor glycaemic control.
The NCEPOD (2018) goes on to state that only three fifths of preoperative assessment clinics had a specific policy for the management of patients with diabetes, and only 47% of patients were provided with written instructions on the management of their diabetes preoperatively.  This report provides a clear recommendation that patients with diabetes must be optimised preoperatively and that NHS Trusts must adopt policies for doing so. In November 2020, NHS Improvement (GIRFT, 2021) commenced supporting Trusts to adopt a perioperative care pathwaydeveloped by the IP3D project (Page et al, 2020).   This literature review will be used to influence the test and learn phase of a quality improvement project to adopt a modified version of this pathway. 

2.0 Methods
2.1 Search Strategy
A comprehensive literature search of English language publications was conducted using databases available via the university electronic library.  The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Medical Literature Analysis and Reviews System Online (MEDLINE) and PubMed were selected due to their broad index of healthcare resources.  
Moule et al (2017) suggest a clearly defined theme is essential to finding relevant literature and avoid time wasting.  An initial ‘quick search’ for ‘preoperative diabetes pathway’ identified an unmanageable number of hits.  However, Bomer-Norton (2019) advise using the results of a quick search to focus in on key words used within the topic area. This was performed and key words were identified (Table 1).  Wildcard symbols and truncation tools were used, as recommended by Polit & Beck (2017) to account for different spellings and search for words with the same word stem.  The Boolean operators ‘AND’ and ‘OR’, which Bomer-Norton (2019) suggests can help to determine the relationship between search terms, were also used.  Date limits were applied to include only literature published in the last 10 years, as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [NICE] (2018) suggests controlling search dates to ensure contemporary data.

2.2 Results and selection of literature
The search yielded 73 results (Appendix 1; PRISMA), of which 22 were duplicates and were removed.  The snowballing technique was used, as recommended by Moule et al (2017), to conduct a further search of the reference lists of papers sourced to identify 4 additional studies.  It is possible these were not picked up by the initial search due to the variety of descriptors used within this broad topic area.  The titles and abstracts of the remaining 55 were reviewed and 45 were excluded as they failed to meet the inclusion criteria for this review (Table 2).  A further paper was rejected as it proved to be a study design only.  

Table 2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria and rationale
Inclusion Criteria	Rational	Exclusion Criteria	Rationale
Published between 2011-2021	Contemporary data	Published before 2011	Non-contemporary data
Adults with type 1 & type 2 diabetes	Transferable findings	Paediatrics/gestational diabetes	Non-transferable findings
Programmes or pathways of care	Transferable findings	Studies of specific medications	Non-transferable/risk of bias
Original studies	Non-duplicated data		


The remaining 9 papers included studies into the outcome of glycaemic optimisation programmes (4), the relationship between the timing of assessments and day of surgery (2), recording of HbA1c at the time of referral (2), and patient experience (1). 

2.3 Evaluation of literature
Understanding the hierarchy of research can allowpractitioners to better evaluate the quality of it (Grove, 2019).  Moule et al (2017) suggest quantitative research designs feature at the top of this hierarchy as they are more scientifically rigorous with larger samples, meaning they provide more robust and generalisable evidence of effectiveness.  However, Polit and Beck (2017) argue, the best evidence comes from research which is methodologically appropriate and answers the relevant question.  Eight of the studies within this review are quantitative in nature: four retrospective cohort studies, one prospective cohort studies, two retrospective studies and one randomised controlled trial (RCT). The final paper is a mixed methods study which will allow a degree of triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data.  Moule et al (2017) suggest triangulation provides a more complete understanding of an issue.
The use of an appraisal tool to critique research papers can help to trigger more in-depth questioning (Moule et al, 2017).  As such, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme [CASP] (2018) evaluation tool was used to aid critique of each study. 

3.0 Critical review of literature 
Bomer-Norton (2019) suggests the purpose of a literature review is to identify, critically appraise and synthesise studies to conclude the effectiveness of a particular intervention.  As this review incorporates studies focussing on different aspects of the preoperative pathway, these have been grouped by intervention to allow for synthesis of findings.  Polit and Beck (2017) suggest synthesising literature in this way can help to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support replication of an intervention or whether further study is required.  To avoid description of the studies within the body of this review, a summary table (Appendix 2) has been provided.  
3.1 Preoperative glycaemic improvement programmes
Four papers were identified involving preoperative glycaemic optimisation programmes.  Lee et al (2014) was the only RCT identified.  It was also the smallest study with a sample of 24 participants.  Within this study, patients were allocated to usual care or an intervention groups, with the latter receiving individualised diabetes optimisation education and support prior to surgery.  The remaining three papers were retrospective cohort studies analysing the effect of an intervention against baseline data.  In contrast to Lee et al (2014), Garg et al (2016) and Garg et al (2018) were by far the largest studies identified with a sample of 3909 patients over 4 years.  The 2016 paper was a study conducted in two phases evaluating the effect of a preoperative optimisation programme delivered by physicians (phase 1) and then the same programme delivered by nurses (phase 2).  The 2018 paper reanalysed the whole data against a broader range of outcome measures.  The final of the four papers (Page et al, 2020) is distinct in that it involved a broader perioperative programme including the introduction of a Diabetes Perioperative Specialist Nurse (DPSN) to provide patient and staff education and the implementation of a patient passport.  
Blood glucose was a key outcome measure in all four studies, with consistent findings of improved glycaemic control within the intervention groups.  Although the results are not sufficiently comparable to provide meta-analysis, every study reported probability-values (p-values) of <0.5 within this outcome measure.  P-values are used in quantitative research to indicate those results unlikely to have occurred by coincidence, with p=<0.05 generally considered to be statistically significant (Parahoo, 2014).  
By far the greatest improvement in blood glucose was noted in Page et al (2020) which reported a mean decrease in HbA1c from 85 to 62mmol/mol (p=<0.0001) among those participants receiving individualised support from the DPSN.  However, not all participants received support and analysis of data for all patients failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in the number achieving target HbA1c overall.  There were similar findings within phase 1 of the Garg et al (2016) study, which found that while 87% of those receiving one-to-one support achieved target blood glucose; this reduced to just 79% across the whole sample.  The authors highlight this discrepancy and conclude their results represent the delivery of healthcare in a real-world setting with finite resources.  McCoy (2017) suggests that such intention-to-treat analysis (analysis of data from all participants in a study) can help to reduce bias and improve generalisibility of results.  For the purposes of this review, however, these figures highlight the greater level of improvement that can be achieved with the benefit of one-to-one support. 
HbA1c was the only outcome measure to achieve statistical significance within Lee et al (2014).  RCTs are generally considered the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness of an intervention as random sampling limits potential for bias and error (Grove, 2019a).  However, Lee et al (2014) state that due to ethical reasons participants with the highest HbA1cs were non-randomly allocated to the intervention group leading to heterogeneity in baseline HbA1c and, therefore, the potential for bias of findings.  Furthermore, such small samples can result in the underpowering of studies to reject the null hypothesis (Grove, 2019b).  They can also increase the risk of type II error; a finding that something is not significant when it may be (Grove& Cipher, 2017).  Indeed, this study failed to reject the null hypothesis for 3 out of 4 baseline measures, all of which achieved statistical significance in the other studies.   However, Polit & Beck (2017) suggest consideration of papers with less rigorous methodology can still help to broaden the understanding of a topic.
By comparison, Garg et al (2016), Garg et al (2018) and Page et al (2020) are considerably better powered with convenience samples of between 351-3909 participants and include all eligible patients within the specified timeframes.  Grove (2019b) argues that although convenience sampling allows for little control of bias, larger samples are more likely to be representative and, therefore, the results more generalisable.  As such, it may be concluded that if the study designs were replicated elsewhere, improved blood glucose control could be achieved. 
Page et al (2020) also reported improvements in outcome measures for length of stay and hypoglycaemia, although the authors note that, due to the broader perioperative nature of this programme, it is not possible to isolate the effects of individual aspects of the intervention to these outcome measures.  Improvements were also seen for these outcome measures in Garg et al (2018) which focussed on preoperative optimisation only.  However, Garg et al (2018) suggest this may be due to increased involvement of the diabetes team preoperatively leading to better care and discharge planning.  Parahoo (2014) suggests the inability to exclude extraneous variables from retrospective cohort studies weakens the reliability of this methodology; Garg et al (2018) go on to suggest their results should be verified by RCT.  Pragmatically, however, these results still add weight to the suggestion that improved diabetes management preoperatively is associated with decreased postoperative hypoglycaemia and length of stay.  
An interesting phenomenon noted by Garg et al (2016) is the benefit of specialist nurse intervention.  Greater improvements were noted in every outcome measure for the nurse-led phase, although the difference was not statistically significant in every measure.  This suggests that nurse-led preoperative diabetes optimisation is at least as good as physician-led.  It may be further considered this finding is supported by Page et al (2020), which was similarly a nurse-led programme.  
These studies consistently demonstrate that preoperative diabetes optimisation programmes can result in improved glycaemic control.  Although Lee et al (2014) is not as rigorous in its methodology, its findings in this one aspect add weight to those of Garg et al (2016), Garg et al (2018) and Page et al (2020)which are likely to be generalisable to other real-world settings.  The studies also indicate greater improvements can be achieved when patients receive one-to-one support.  Furthermore, nurse-led programmes of care can be as beneficial as those led by physicians.  What these studies fail to demonstrate definitively, however, is whether preoperative diabetes optimisation can result in reduced inpatient complications or length of stay, with Garg et al (2018) suggesting further research is warranted into this. 

3.2 Timing of preoperative optimisation
Two retrospective studies were identified which focussed on the timings of preoperative glycaemic optimisation.  Patel et al (2016) reviewed records of all patients with an HbA1c of >8% (>64mmol/mol) attending preoperative assessment over a 30month period.  Their aim was to determine whether the length of interval between evaluation and surgery date could be associated with day of surgery (DOS) blood glucose (BG) levels.  Houlden et al (2018) reviewed the records of the first 75 patients with an HbA1c of >7.5% (>58mmol/mol) attending a newly introduced glycaemic optimisation clinic for patients awaiting bariatric surgery.  In this study, reductions in HbA1c were recorded against the interval taken to achieve. 
Although the timeframes for intervention were significantly different – Patel et al (2016) recorded interval in days, Houlden et al (2018) in months - both papers reported greater improvements with longer intervals.  Patel et al (2016) found the lowest mean DOS BG was reported in those attending preoperative assessment >10 days before surgery (p=<0.1 when compared to DOS BG for those attending <3 days before surgery).  Meanwhile, Houlden et al (2018) found 75% of patients achieved a target HbA1c of 7.5% after five months, compared to just 32% after one month.  95% achieved 8.5% (69mmol/mol) within 5 months.  Garg et al (2016) also noted time available before surgery as an independent predictor of achieving target BG (p=0.534), although no further information was provided within this paper regarding timeframes.  
When contrasting these papers, it should be noted the results are not directly comparable due differences in measurement.  While blood glucose reading gives a snapshot in time, HbA1c represents average blood glucose over a 3-month period.  Therefore, improvements are likely to be identified sooner with blood glucose readings than HbA1c.  Indeed, the incremental increase seen within Houlden et al (2018) declines from 3 months.  It is also of note that both studies rely on analysis of retrospective data.  Parahoo (2014) argues data collected in this way may lack veracity as it is not recorded for the purposes of the study.  Both authors suggest further research is needed to confirm their findings. 
Overall, these studies suggest evaluating and optimising glycaemic control earlier can result in better control, however, they fail to confirm an optimal timeframe within which this can be achieved, and further research would be beneficial to broaden the understanding of this issue.

3.3 Increased HbA1c monitoring
Three studies reported on increased HbA1c monitoring in the preoperative period.  Underwood et al (2015) was a 3-year retrospective cohort study of patients attending a preoperative clinic to evaluate the effect of a programme to improve HbA1c testing and identification of those requiring diabetes intervention.  Hommel et al (2017) was a 12-month prospective cohort study to assess the impact of a multifaceted strategy to improve perioperative diabetes optimisation.  Improvements implemented were based on overcoming identified barriers to optimal care including lack of ownership of preoperative diabetes optimisation.  Garg et al (2018) also reported on HbA1c testing among its other findings.
At baseline, Underwood et al (2015) reported 37% of patients with diabetes received preoperative HbA1c monitoring.  Following intervention this increased to 93% (p=<0.0001), with 17% identified as requiring optimisation.  Those achieving their DOS BG target increased from 67% to 80% (p=0.005).  Garg et al (2018) noted frequency of HbA1c testing increased from 31% to 69%, although do not suggest outcomes are attributable to this.  By contrast, Hommel et al (2017) reported a more modest increase in preoperative HbA1c monitoring of 9% (p=0.002), although they fail to state the proportion of patients this represents.  Those achieving target blood glucose values failed to achieve significance.  
When comparing prospective and retrospective study designs, Grove and Gray (2019) suggest the former methodology should be more reliable due to the act of documenting findings as they occur.  This suggests the findings of Hommel et al (2017) are likely to be more reliable.  However, Hommel et al (2017) is distinct within this review as the only study to fail to implement interventions within the specified timeframe.  As a result, increased HbA1c monitoring was 1 of only 2 outcome measures to reject the null hypothesis.  The authors conclude a lack of ownership of diabetes optimisationremained a barrier throughout the study.  By contrast, both Underwood et al (2015) and Page et al (2020) reported increased clinician satisfactionand efficacy following the introduction of their programme suggesting the effects of cultural differences within Trusts.
The findings of Underwood et al (2015) suggest increased preoperative HbA1c testing can lead to improvements in the number of patients achieving optimal control.  As with the papers in section 3.1, this study was well powered, which Grove (2019b) suggeststrengthens the generalisability of findings.  The findings are not supported by Hommel et al (2017), however, Grove (2019c) suggests non-significant results should not be seen as negative results when flaws exist in the methodology of a study, in this case the incompleteness of interventions.  What both papers do demonstrate, however, is the need for an engaged and proactive clinical team to act upon the results of increased testing. 


3.4 Patient experience
Page et al (2017) was a mixed methods study of patients using a diabetes perioperative passport, the findings of which were later summarised in Page et al (2020).  The passport was a paper booklet provided to patients preoperatively and designed to empower optimal diabetes management.  Within the study patients were randomly allocated to passport or usual care groups.  Patients completed questionnaires postoperatively about their experience; structured interviews were also conducted with the passport group.  
The most significant finding of this study was the number of patients reporting receiving information preoperatively about their diabetes care, reported at 35% in the control group and 92% in the passport group (p<0.001).  The latter group also reported the written information to be more helpful (p<0.001), felt more involved in planning their diabetes care (p=<0.001) and less anxious while in hospital (p<0.044). Content analysis of the qualitative interview indicated the passport was well liked by all participants who felt it helped them to be better prepared for surgery. These findings appear to be supported by Lee et al (2014) whose quantitative analysis indicated higher levels of self-efficacy among patients post interventi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ensure you include Introduction, Discussion and Conclusion sections in this chapter.  Additional, headings within the discussion are acceptable here if needed.
Introduction
This should set the scene and get the reader interested in the topic.  Provide a clear scope for what you will cover and why.
It is not necessary to include detailed information on how you conducted your literature search / review but and you should provide context by demonstrating how and why you have taken a particular focus. This should include the presentation of your mapping out of the identified topics and issues relevant to your study detailing what you may have included/excluded and the reasons for this.  It is often a good idea to use some form of figure to show this to reduce overall descriptive text.
 
Main Discussion
Expand on your introductory literature review to give a full account of the relevant literature and evidence base.
Identify the relationship of your research to previous work in the subject area (i.e., has it been done before, and if so, how?)
It is vital to use subheadings in a piece of work of this magnitude. Subheadings should have been identified from your mapping out of topics in preparation for your literature search.
Critically discuss the current issues relevant to your research area and ensure you remain focused and on topic.
 
Conclusion
A summary of the major elements from your search and discussion of the literature and evidence base; and how they link to the research.
NB: When referring to other studies/projects within the literature review at master’s level it is essential to critique these i.e., state if they were large or small studies, if findings were significant etc. Make sure you compare and contrast studies, where available, and offer explanations for differences.

Do a critical review on an issue in Primary education: A short (1000 word, approximately 4 to 6 sources) annotated bibliography on a chosen issue in Primary education followed by a 500-word discussion and conclusion on the implications for teaching Primary.
The assignment is divided into two sections:

1.	Annotated Bibliography (approx. 1000 words). 
This task involves a critical summary and evaluation of four to six sources on the chosen theme or topic relating to a critical issue in Primary Education. All sources need to be related to your chosen title. You should include at least three sources from the following categories: 

•	DfE or Ofsted policy or research documents 
•	EEF meta-studies 
•	Peer-reviewed journal articles 
•	Books from academic publishers 

2.	A short discussion and conclusion on the implications for teaching subject (approx. 500 words).

In general, to access the highest marks you will need to engage with your topic critically and analytically by evaluating what you read, demonstrating application where possible and synthesising new ideas. As such, it is recommended that you try to keep your assignment focussed and favour depth over breadth. In this section, you can engage with some additional sources to further develop your argument.


General Tips
All sources must be cited correctly throughout the text and acknowledged in a reference list, utilising the Harvard referencing convention. Your work should be of a high standard of accuracy in terms of spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

Some Dos and Don’ts:
In no particular order:
•	Use a variety of literature. Try to engage with books, journals, websites, government or subject association publications and others.
•	It is ok to use material from the media however do not rely solely on it. You are writing an academic essay, and your source material should reflect that.
•	Avoid using sources such as Wikipedia and about.com.
•	Do write in full and avoid contractions. Write “it is not”, rather than “it isn’t”; “it cannot” rather than “it can’t”; “I will”, rather than “I’ll”; “do not”, rather than “don’t”; etc.
•	Do reference properly. You are an information specialist and understand how consistent referencing of material is important, including full referencing of web resources. You should ensure your referencing follows the Harvard referencing convention. 
•	Do include short quotations (less than two lines) in the body of a paragraph within quotation marks, making sure to provide a page reference. Longer quotations should be ‘block quoted’, i.e. an indented paragraph of their own.
•	Do reflect on what you quote; explain why the point the author is making is important for you but be prepared to critique it.
•	Do organise your text into paragraphs (groups of sentences with a common theme, a minimum of four sentences to a paragraph is a guide). Be consistent; break each paragraph with a double line break. Do not put a lot of text together without a paragraph or be inconsistent with your line breaking. Do not indent the first line of a new paragraph.
•	Do write numbers less than 10 in words and numbers 10 or greater using numerals. The exceptions to this are when the number is data or part of a noun, for instance “a year 7 class” or “the response to question 3” or “6% of the sample”.
•	Do write in the first person where this fits naturally. For example, “this study is going to look at pupil behaviour in a Year 9 ICT lesson. I am interested in behaviour in Year 9 as I have observed so far that this is the year group that is most challenging of authority and teacher instructions”. Be consistent though, constantly switching back and forth to/from first person is extremely confusing and disorienting for the reader. Pick a perspective and stick to it.
•	Passive voice is acceptable throughout if you prefer (scientists tend to), but you may find it more difficult to express yourself in this manner. For a literature review, a passive voice is preferred and for a reflective piece, an active voice is the preferred written style.
•	Ensure that you proof-read your work and check your apostrophes, punctuation, spelling and typos. 
•	Do check your use of it’s (it is), its (possessive); students (they), a student’s (his/her), students’ (their).
•	Do read through your text for meaning. Use short sentences where you can and keep it simple. Avoid convoluted or redundant phrases. For example, this is long winded and convoluted:

Open ended questioning within a class environment would allow the teacher to find out and collect evidence for what pupils know and understand about a topic and, more than this, allows for pupils’ misconceptions to be made clear to everyone and to be highlighted by the teacher asking questions.

The same idea is expressed more clearly as:
Open ended questioning allows the teacher to find out what pupils know. Moreover, it can give insight into pupils’ misconceptions.

•	Do be creative in your use of literature; explore websites that embrace teacher led research, such as the EEF, TES, NFER etc.

Chapter 1: problem statement
This chapter lays the foundation for your research.  You should aim to do the following:

•	Introduce the research project and topic.  Make clear, in brief terms, the content/scope of the project, set the scene, provide contextual and background information

•	Indicate what the chapter does and in what order


•	Define key terms.  Use robust references from specialist professional/academic sources; avoid websites and general dictionary definitions

•	Provide the rationale for the focus of your research.  Indicate the identified issue or knowledge gap, why you have chosen the topic, why it is of importance.  Back up your choice by referring to relevant current documents/reports (these might have been published by WHO, NICE, SCIE, Welsh/UK government, NHS, ONS, King’s Fund, Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation etc.) as well as a brief overview of some relevant  current research

•	Set out the aim and objectives of the project.  The aim is often set out as a question, and the objectives as sub-questions (these can be bullet-pointed)

•	Provide a brief overview of the rest of the dissertation.  Say briefly what each of the remaining chapters in the dissertation does.

•	Provide a brief summary of chapter one and a link to the next chapter


Important: do not assume your reader has prior knowledge of the topic/question.  This means that you need to outline clearly the background/rationale and define any terms that are context-specific and specialist.  This is essential in ensuring clarity and accessibility (reports are often read by different stakeholders with different knowledge-bases).



 
Chapter 2: methodology and methods
This chapter explains the research approach and the steps/strategies used in carrying out the research.  You should aim to do the following:

•	Introduce the chapter and say what it does and in what order

•	Describe and justify the choice of methodology, using appropriate literature to substantiate decisions.  Explain how you carried out your project, namely by conducting a literature review of published work relating to your topic (not by conducting your own empirical/primary research).  Indicate why this research design was selected and describe how/why this approach is used in health and social care.
•	Describe the methods (again using appropriate literature to substantiate decisions) including:
o	Where/how you searched for literature: this is likely to have been a combination of using databases, carrying out manual searches and using a ‘snowballing’ (or ‘bread crumb’) technique
o	List the databases and index/indices used (e.g. Pubmed, Medline,  CINAHL etc.)
o	List the key search terms used when searching databases, giving brief reasons as to why these were selected; indicate use of variations of terminology, Boolean operators etc.  Indicate the number of ‘hits’ generated for different key search terms.
o	Indidate the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria applied, for instance the years covered by the search (and why), restriction to a particular geographical area (and why), a particular demographic (and why) etc.
o	Indicate whether you ‘expanded’ or ‘focused’ your search as your research developed.

•	Describe the methods of critiquing and analysing literature (again using appropriate literature to substantiate decisions).  Indicate how you critically appraised the literature: typically this will have involved the use of critical appraisal tools such as those produced by the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP).  Indicate how you anlysed the literature: typically this will have involved looking for patterns/topics that recur across the literature, in a process known as, ‘thematic analysis’

•	Discuss ethics (with reference to appropriate literature).  Briefly indicate the background to/role of ethics in health and social care research.  Indicate your screening of reviewed literature for ethical approval when relevant  (e.g. when reviewing primary research articles).  Indicate that your dissertation did not require ethical approval (because it reviewed existing literature, and therefore involved no direct contact with study participants)

•	Chapter Summary and link to the next chapter

Important: clarity/detail is key.  There must be adequate information for another researcher to be able to replicate your steps (and, in theory, arrive at the same results).


Chapter 3:  literature review
The literature review chapter is integral to the entire dissertation.  Its main purpose is to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of existing literature pertaining to your chosen topic/question.  By implementing a thematic approach, you can cohesively present, critique, compare, contrast and analyse identified relevant literature.  This chapter should include the following elements:

•	Introduction to the chapter, saying what it does and in what order, the main aim being to present a structured review of relevant literature. 

	Thematic analysis/synethesis of identified literature: grouping together literature into themes identifies commonalities and aids understanding of the core discussions within the chosen topic.  Each theme should be discussed in a separate (suitably subtitled) section.  This section of the chapter should include:
 
	brief background to each theme including relevant definitions;
	critical evaluation of key studies that underpin the topic, including their importance, contribution, potential limitations, how they relate to the research question;
	identification of controversies/strengths/weaknesses, highlighting any significant disagreements or debates.  If there are recurrent issues or methodological weaknesses associated with a theme, these should be discussed

•	Identification of gaps in the literature: a vital aspect of the literature review is to recognise what has not been said or thoroughly explored.  These gaps can highlight potential avenues for future research and underscore the relevance of your own study.

•	Chapter summary and link to next chapter:  summarise by bringing together the main themes, their importance, and the gaps you have identified. Briefly introduce the next chapter.


Important:  do not just read - analyse.  Using guiding questions and critiquing tools helps provide a richer synthesis.








Chapter 4:  discussion
In a desk-based undergraduate dissertation in health and social care, the main objective of the discussion chapter is to provide an overview/synthesis of key findings, to explore the implications of the literature reviewed, and to provide a personal analysis/interpretation of the subject.  In this chapter, you should aim to include the following:

•	Introduce the chapter and say what it does and in what order, the main aim being to discuss the findings from the previous chapter and consider them in the light of wider evidence. 

•	Statement of main findings: briefly summarise the main findings/themes from the previous chapter; convey the general meaning and ‘capture the essence’

•	Comparative analysis: revisit the the prominent points/themes from the previous chapter and situate them in the broader context of health and social care.  Consider the wider importance of the findings, how they interrelate and how they contribute to the wider discourse in health and social care.  Do this by relating them to other research on the same or similar topics, to policy, to professional guidelines and to theory (areas that may have been touched upon in the introductory chapter). 

•	Identification of strengths/limitations: in essence, this is a critical appraisal of your own work.  Acknowledging the potential limitations and indicating the possible strengths inherent in the dissertation help to contextualise and display a critical understanding of the topic.

•	Personal reflection and analysis: provide a personal (and honest) perspective on the research project/topic by considering your personal development as a researcher, the ‘research journey’, and what you would do the the same/differently next time.  

•	Chapter summary and link to the next chapter

Important: the discussion chapter relies on your analysis and critical thinking.  It should not just recap the literature review chapter, but should demonstrate your ability to evaluate research findings, to situate them in the ‘bigger picture’ of health and social care and to reach logical conclusions.  To do this, you need to ensure that your writing is clear, concise, and free of jargon. 
 
Chapter 5: conclusion and recommendations

This chapter concludes the dissertation by revisiting the aim and objectives, discussing the process of literature searching, highlighting the key findings and considering their implications in terms of future development of the topic area.  In this chapter you should aim to do the following:

•	Introduce the chapter and say what it does and in what order.

•	Revisit the aim and objectives of the dissertation: remind the reader of the aim and objectives as set out in Chapter One.  This gives coherence to the dissertation by creating a full circle

•	Reflection on literature searching:  discuss the process of finding the research reviewed in Chapter Three; consider any issues faced when retrieving relevant materials, for instance the extent to which terminology made searching straightforward/complex, the availability of required publications etc. 

•	Highlight evidence shortfalls: point out the gaps or deficiencies you identified in the existing literature; this could include issues related to research methods, such as questionable sample sizes, unclear analysis strategies, or other related issues such as a lack of diverse perspectives (e.g. the extent to which different ethnicities were included in research)

•	Project findings: concisely summarise the principal findings of the literature review chapter.

•	Study contribution: explain how your project adds to the existing body of knowledge.  Describe any new insights or perspectives that might add value to the existing literature/knowledge-base.

•	Recommendations: present suggestions for the future development of your topic areas. Structure these as clear bullet points, highlighting potential ways forward for practice/training, policy, education, and further research.  These should naturally flow from your literature review, so it is important to check that each recommendation relates to an issue discussed earlier in the dissertation.   

•	Chapter summary: briefly sum up the chapter.  A thought-provoking closing comment about the topic can be an interesting way to round off the dissertation, leaving the reader with something to ponder (a ‘take-home message’) 

Important: the conclusion and recommendations chapter should be a distillation of the dissertation, encapsulating its core elements without introducing anything new; it is about giving the reader a clear sense of your journey, the key findings, and actionable insights.

PSY223 Developmental Psychology Practical Attachment

Attachment Security
Context: You are a developmental psychologist and member of the adoption support team at Tower Hamlets. Your role is to assess attachment quality between caregivers and adopted children in order to suggest suitable support for the families (if necessary).
Background: The development of a secure attachment in early childhood reflects an important component of positive development with implications across the life-course (Sroufe, 2005). Adopted children often have a history of caregiver deprivation or severe disruption of the child-caregiver relationship during those early years that are crucial for the formation of attachment. Although children that are placed in their adopted families within the first year after birth often develop similar attachment patterns as children raised in biological families, children adopted after the first 12 months tend to show less attachment security compared to non-adopted children (van den Dries et al., 2009). Importantly, empirical studies suggest that it is possible to promote attachment security through psychological interventions aimed at the child- caregiver relationship (Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2003). In young children attachment security is often measured with the Strange Situation procedure developed by Mary Ainsworth (Ainsworth & Bell, 1970).
Task: Assess the attachment pattern (A, B, C, or D) between a caregiver and her infant based on a video of the Strange Situation Procedure. Then make suggestions for adequate psychological support as indicated according to your assessment of the attachment pattern. Use material from the lecture, practical, textbook as well as other reliable sources.
What you need to do for the assignment:
• Pick one of two cases (Theresa or Carla). Videos of the strange
situation procedure for both cases can be viewed on QMPlus
(although it is very important to attend the practical on February 13th)
• Analyse the video with the information provided in order to determine the attachment pattern
• Write a report containing the following four sections (use the report template):
1. Shortliteraturereviewonadoptionandattachmentsecurity(include
references)
2. Descriptionoftheselectedvideo(useprovidedgrid)
3. Assessment of the attachment pattern (only A, B, C, D, no
subgroups) based on interpretation of the strange situation procedure (use provided information on scoring: Waters_2002_The Ainsworth Strange Situation)
4. Suggestionsforinterventioninordertopromoteattachmentsecurity for the specific child (include references)
Word limit:
• 1,500 words (+/- 10% not including title or references in reference list)

For more information please refer to the below article, I have recently written The Reality of the Innovator Founder Visa: A Contradiction to British Immigration Views The United Kingdom has long been a country that has welcomed immigrants from around the world. Surveys have recently shown that most British people hold a positive view of immigration, recognizing the contributions that newcomers make to the country\'s social and economic fabric. However, in recent years, there seems to be a contradiction between these positive views and the actions of the UK government, particularly when it comes to immigration policies. This discrepancy is nowhere more evident than in the case of the Innovator Founder Visa, which was designed to attract innovative entrepreneurs to the UK but has, in many cases, failed to deliver on its promises. Rising Visa Fees and Restrictive Measures The UK government\'s approach to immigration in recent years has been marked by an increase in visa fees across all categories, making it more expensive for individuals and families to come to the UK. In addition to higher fees, the government has implemented measures that curtail the number of international students who can study in the UK, limiting which universities can sponsor them. One of the most controversial moves was the removal of dependent visas, making it difficult for the families of students to accompany them. The Innovator Founder Visa was introduced with the aim of encouraging entrepreneurs and innovators to establish their businesses in the UK, boosting the country\'s tech and innovation sectors. However, recent changes to the visa program have raised concerns about its effectiveness and the government\'s commitment to fostering innovation. The Flawed Innovator Founder Visa One of the most glaring issues with the Innovator Founder Visa is the role of endorsing bodies. These organizations are meant to assess business plans and ideas submitted by visa applicants. However, many entrepreneurs have encountered a disheartening reality when dealing with these endorsing bodies. Instead of receiving meaningful feedback and a fair assessment, applicants often face a daunting and complicated process, culminating in a disappointing \""failed\"" result. The Process of Endorsement International entrepreneurs who aspire to come to the UK invest considerable time and resources in developing their business plans, adhering to the guidelines set by endorsing bodies. It is a demanding process, which includes creating a detailed business plan that aligns with the UK\'s business and innovation standards. However, despite the hard work, financial investment, and commitment from these applicants, they often receive a \""failed\"" verdict. This outcome is perplexing, given the stringent requirements placed upon them, including the need to craft a comprehensive business plan that adheres to the endorsing body\'s guidelines. It raises questions about the intentions of these endorsing bodies. The Profitable Path of Rejection One troubling aspect of the Innovator Founder Visa program is that, in some cases, it appears more beneficial for endorsing bodies to reject applicants rather than approve them. This notion arises from the hefty £1,000 fee that applicants are required to pay when seeking endorsement. With rejection being the easier outcome for these endorsing bodies, they seem to have little incentive to genuinely support aspiring entrepreneurs. A Community of Questions The international entrepreneurial community has been left bewildered by the contradictions in the UK\'s immigration policy. If the government is genuinely uninterested in attracting immigrant entrepreneurs, why launch the Innovator Founder Visa program in the first place? These policies not only deter talented innovators from coming to the UK but also damage the country\'s reputation as a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship. The Innovator Founder Visa, designed to attract entrepreneurs and innovators to the UK, has become a source of frustration and disappointment for many international applicants. The endorsement process, which is meant to identify and support promising businesses, has left many entrepreneurs disheartened and questioning the government\'s intentions. In a time when the UK is facing stiff global competition in the tech and innovation sectors, the Innovator Founder Visa should be a beacon of hope, attracting top talent to the country. However, the reality is far from the government\'s stated goals, with endorsing bodies seemingly more interested in collecting fees than genuinely supporting innovation. It is high time for the UK government to reevaluate its immigration policies and ensure that they align with the country\'s genuine aspirations for economic growth and innovation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,191.4,9.57,181.83,,,,26/02/2024 5:20,0000-00-00 00:00:00

List of contents – including appendices/list of figures/tables List chapters, chapter titles and their page numbers Appendices should also be listed on the Contents page e.g. Appendix A and the title of the Appendix List of abbreviations- glossary (this is optional, but may be appropriate especially if your study uses a lot of abbreviations). Abstract Abstract should provide a synopsis of your work and invite the reader to continue reading the rest of your work. It should include the following: The aim of the research The research methods used- mainly review of literature The main results/findings- the main messages that you want to convey from each literature review chapter The main conclusions and recommendations It should be one paragraph long- no longer than a page at its maximum. It should appear after the title page (and acknowledgements and contents page). Chapters: All chapters in your Major Project must: Begin with a title and chapter number. They must include an introduction (a short paragraph), explaining the purpose of your chapter, reasons why that content is important and organisation of the content. Introduction of each chapter should remind the reader the objectives of the chapter, and also provide a brief statement of what you are about to discuss. Finish each chapter with a conclusion: Tell the reader main messages from your chapter. Conclusion from each chapter can also be used as an opportunity to signpost the reader to the next section/ chapter, i.e., how the conclusion almost creates a need to discuss the next topic of your research. Each chapter should start from a new page Chapters should be numbered Page numbers (use page footers) Make full use of headings and sub-headings within chapters to provide a clear structure to your material and to highlight key points. Chapter 1. Introduction Start by putting your research in context: why your research is worth doing. Try to identify the gap in research and the topic that you are addressing. Write down key 5-7 readings/authors that you find most influential (better to pick them up from your literature review chapter). Explain why their views/ work is so influential and how they fit together in relation to your overall topic. Clarify the focus of your study: Explain the focus and rationale of your study. Link the research focus with the background information that you have provided above. Everything has to be written in one continuous flow. Use transitional phrases to make links between different sections explicit. Introduce the main focus/foci, explaining why research in your chosen area is important, and the overall importance of the research field. You might suggest that the area/topic you have picked to research lacks critical investigation; or you may be looking at a particular focus/ lens/ angle and this could be seen as adding value too. The rationale can be grounded in your professional practice, personal experiences or academic study/ learning, or a combination of all. Specify your specific research aims and objectives. Research will have an overall aim. Objectives will stem from the overall aim, explaining how that aim will be met. Objectives can be written numerically or in bullet points. Aim for approximately 2-3 objectives. These objectives must be addressed in your research- one way of doing this is by discussing these objectives explicitly in your forthcoming chapters/ referring to them in your findings chapter. You can choose to only write aim(s) and not include objectives in your study. Discuss the methodology used- for example, the use of information from peer reviewed research journals, textbooks and policy documents. You can give examples by naming those journals or books that you particularly found useful. You can discuss how you organised this information into smaller chunks of meaningful discussions. The idea is to be transparent about the retrieving, sifting, sorting and meaning making of the information. You can also mention the main keywords used to search the information, for example, play, assessment, EYFS, attachment, etc. Doing research ethically is paramount. Discuss how you retrieved and used the information ethically- by researching and acknowledging sources appropriately. Discuss how ethically and honestly you represented the ideas of the authors, without manipulating any information or data to suit your purpose. Towards the end, include a brief signposting to the structure of your UMP. This can be in the form of a short paragraph that explains the purpose of each chapter in your dissertation. Overall, your introduction must include sub-sections with appropriate headings/subheadings and should highlight some of the key references that you plan to use in the main study. You can draft an introduction early but come back to it at the end, after completing the rest of the chapters of your Major Project. By this time you would already know the literature review and the key authors. Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4 – Literature Reviews (the number of chapters may vary according to your topic) Give title and number to each chapter and write a separate introduction and conclusion for each literature review chapter. Each chapter will focus upon a particular topic surrounding your research. Below are some general guidelines that you may want to use for literature review: Review the key literature in your chosen area. Discuss the subject content and academic knowledge of your topic. The review of literature should help you to contextualise your research in the body of established knowledge. Show that you are aware what has already been researched and thought about, researched and written in your area of interest. Use headings and sub-headings to structure the literature review. Treat each chapter like a mini essay which helps you to answer the research questions(s) that you earlier raised in your dissertation. Chapter 5 – Conclusion You can include the following four key sections in your conclusion: A summary of your main findings and the conclusion Limitations of your research Any recommendations for future research (these can originate from your limitations) Main contribution to knowledge You can also include a small section on self-reflection, for example, how do you think you have grown as a researcher, overall. References List in alphabetical order Avoid bullet points Correctly referenced Only include references that are cited in the text in different chapters Please use references as much as possible. The number I have mentioned at the bottom is just for the example.

It should have a clear set of aims and intentions and a well-developed argument, or a thesis. The argument is the central pole of the dissertation. It needs to be corroborated by research findings and by existing and properly referenced academic literature. Your dissertation should pull together organically whatever material you have gathered into a tight, concise, and clear statement that tells us what it is about. Its argument should be laid out in such a way that its key and clearly identifiable points follow naturally from each other. The structure of the argument is logical and coherent. You need to guide the reader through the steps in the argument and ensure that the sections link together. The structure of the argument needs to be transparent to the reader. Your dissertation should address theoretical, methodological, and substantive debates relevant to your topic. You need to draw on, and fully and properly reference the existing literature relevant to your topic. You need to locate your argument, i.e., position it in relation to existing scholarly work on the topic. The existing literature will inevitably deal with different aspects of the topic in terms of: Theoretical understandings (conceptualisation, links to wider theories of society, explanatory framework, critical assessment, etc.); Methodological approaches (research procedures, bases of evidence, sources of data, inferential reasoning, etc.); Substantive knowledge (empirical claims, general knowledge base, policy issues where relevant, etc.). You need to show how your argument stands in relation to the debates at each of these levels. Your treatment of the literature should be critical. You should assess its worth by arguing critically with it and about it. Reviewing the literature means just what it says: viewing it again, looking at both strengths and weaknesses, things to take forward, and things to leave behind for the purposes of your discussion. It is for this reason that you do not necessarily have to do primary research for your dissertation. A critical review and discussion of secondary literature is quite acceptable and does not carry fewer marks. Finally, your dissertation should be an independent piece of research. Your dissertation is your dissertation: you choose the topic, you decide on the approach, and you make the argument.

Here is a suitable wording for this: “I hereby declare that this assignment is my own work and that I have not copied material from other sources without referencing them, nor colluded with other students to produce this TMA, nor asked anybody else to do all or parts of the work for me (paid or unpaid).” Signed* ……………………………………… Date ……………………………… (Don’t forget to sign this declaration, using a scanned signature or by typing your name) In the main part of the TMA: Use the questions (see below) as headers for each answer that you write. It is advisable to start each question on a fresh page. References Don’t forget to add a list of references. As a minimum you should cite and provide references to the relevant readings in B100 Block 4. TMA 04 task This TMA has three parts. Make sure that you complete all parts. Part 1 asks you to reflect on how you have used feedback from TMA 03, and/or earlier TMAs to help you prepare TMA 04. Part 1 contains one question and is worth 5% of the mark for this TMA. Part 2 is the main part of the TMA. It asks you to analyse a case study, using concepts from Block 4 of B100. Part 2 contains three questions and is worth 80% of the marks for this TMA. Part 3 asks you to describe and reflect on your contributions to the TGF discussions associated with Block 4. Part 3 contains one question and is worth 10% of the mark for this TMA. The remaining 5% of the marks for this TMA are for the correct use of academic and business language and for correct referencing of B100 concepts. Part 1 This part asks you to explain how you have used the feedback you have received on TMA 03 and on previous TMAs to help you prepare TMA 04. It is worth 5% of the marks for this TMA. Question 1 How have you used the feedback you received from your tutor on TMA 03 and/or other previous TMAs to help you prepare TMA 04? Give specific examples of how feedback from TMA 03 (and – if you wish – from earlier TMAs) has informed what you have written in TMA 04. (Use approximately 100 words for this part of the assignment) Part 2 This is the main part of your assignment. It is worth 80% of the marks for this TMA. It is based on your analysis of a case study. Start by reading the case study. Then write your answers to the three questions below. Make sure you answer each of the three questions, and follow the further guidance provided. Question 2 Based on the information contained in the case, and using concepts from B100 Block 4, describe the marketing mix used by the Hanel Winery. (Use approximately 350 words for this question) Question 3 Ari and Paloma have asked you to advise them on how suitable their marketing mix is to increase the number of visitors to the winery and/or sell more of their products to customers beyond the local area. Make recommendations on how they could strengthen their current marketing mix. (Use approximately 300 words for this question) Question 4 After seeing how other wineries operate, Ari and Paloma are interested in improving the societal and environmental aspects of their winery and have asked you to advise them on this. Explain to them how the concept of sustainable marketing could apply to the business. What changes could they make to TWO aspects of the marketing mix to strengthen the environmental and societal credentials of the winery? (Use approximately 350 words for this question) Part 3 This part of the TMA is based on your contributions to the Block 4 TGF discussions. Question 5 Explain how you have participated in ONE TGF activity related to Block 4 and what you have learned from participating in that activity. Remember to identify which TGF you are referring to. (Use approximately 100 words for this part) Guidance for students Guidance on completing each element of this TMA is provided below. Make sure you follow this guidance to achieve a good result. Also make sure you have read the general information and guidance given in the assessment guide. Part 1 Question 1 Here you should select one piece of feedback you have received on a previous TMA and then explain how you have used this to improve your work on TMA 04. Identify which TMA you are referring to and be specific in explaining how the feedback has helped you to address one or several tasks in TMA 04. Part 2 Question 2 Start your answer by briefly explaining what the marketing mix is. Use your own words as much as possible and make sure you add a reference. Then describe the marketing mix used by Hanel Winery, as outlined in the case study. There is information on all of the seven Ps (i.e. the original 4Ps (Product, Price, Place and Promotion) and the 3Ps (People, Process and Physical evidence) associated with services marketing) of the extended marketing mix in the case study, but not an equal amount on each of them. In analysing the case information, make sure you use concepts from B100 Readings 21–27 explicitly. Also make sure you add references to these readings wherever you are using concepts and ideas that come from them. You are also encouraged to bring in other relevant marketing concepts as well as the 7Ps to show wider reading. Question 3 Your answer to this question needs to build on your analysis in the previous answer. Start your answer here with an assessment of the existing marketing mix. What are the good points and where are there any weaknesses? Then make recommendations on how to strengthen TWO elements of their extended marketing mix. Your answer does not have to be long, but your recommendations must fit with your analysis in Question 2 and be suitable for the nature of the business. Hint: Ari and Paloma run a small winery, so they are unlikely to have the financial or managerial resources to, say, invest in an expensive television advertising campaign. Question 4 Use concepts from B100 Reading 21 to help you with this answer. Start by explaining what is meant by the sustainable marketing context. Try to use your own words in doing so and make sure you add a reference. Then explain how the sustainable marketing concept can apply to the Hanel Winery. What would they have to do in order to follow the sustainable marketing concept? Then recommend changes to TWO aspects of the marketing mix that would allow Ari and Paloma to improve the societal and environmental performance of their business. You can think about any two aspects of the marketing mix. Perhaps more could be done to make the winery more environmentally friendly. Or perhaps other elements of the marketing mix could be adapted to make the business more socially and/or environmentally responsible. You can come up with creative solutions here if you wish. Your answer needs to be compatible with your analysis in Q2 and also needs to make sense bearing in mind the nature and size of the business. Part 3 Question 5 Briefly describe what the TGF discussion was about and how you contributed. To explain what you feel you have learned from participating in this discussion you could try to link the content of the discussion to module concepts, or you could consider how your working practices or your study skills have benefitted from participating in the discussion. Case study Marketing the Hanel Winery Written by Sanjay Gandhi Ari and Paloma Stopassola are the owners of the Hanel Winery on the outskirts of the city of Gramado in Brazil. Situated in the south of the country in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Gramado is a small tourist city with a population of 37,000 inhabitants. The city was established by German settlers in the 19th century and is known for its artisanal craft shops and exclusive chocolateries, as well as hosting one of the main film festivals in Brazil. Attracted by the fresh mountain air and extensive forests, Gramado receives an impressive 6.5 million tourists a year, with the greatest flow of visitors between the months of May and August, the Brazilian winter months when temperatures are cooler. The Hanel Winery is a small business set within two hectares of picturesque rolling hills, and it also includes the family home of the Stopassolas. The property contains extensive rows of vines, consisting of grapes of different varieties and the main winery building, encompassing winemaking equipment, warehouses and bottling facilities. At present, the winery produces three types of red wine and a range of sparkling wine. Their grape juice is known for its quality and has won several awards. Ari and Paloma are proud of their current product range but feel it could be expanded. As a small producer, the Hanel Winery focuses on quality and, as a result, they charge a premium price for their products. The couple employ one full-time worker to help with the day-to-day running of the winery and he lives on a small cabin on the estate together with his partner. There are several other small cabins on the estate that are currently unused. The harvest period is quite a labour-intensive time and the Stopassolas often struggle to find sufficient seasonal workers to collect the grapes. Paloma thinks the company could do more to attract workers in busy periods and to ensure they return to work at the winery each year. Ari and Paloma love having conversations about their grapes and wines and enjoy showing visitors around their vineyard and talking to them about the wine production process. Visitors can purchase a tour of the winery through the company’s basic website. Once at the vineyard, visitors can sample wines and juices and are encouraged to stroll around the extensive grounds, which include thick woodlands and freshwater lakes. The Stopassolas would like to host larger groups of visitors, and more often, but feel they don’t have the workforce or facilities to do so, despite their large grounds and picturesque location. Apart from their website, the company does not proactively advertise the winery and relies on word of mouth and personal selling to promote their products The winery is however, featured on the Regional Tourist Board’s website. Although there is no shop or boutique on the winery, customers can buy bottles of wine and grape juice when they visit. The company’s website does not have the facility for customers to purchase wines online. As a result, Ari and Paloma spend a considerable amount of time and money driving to local shops and restaurants to promote and deliver their juices and wines. They feel this is necessary as personal relationships are important in the wine industry. In recent years, there has been less rainfall in the area and the couple are becoming increasingly concerned about the large quantities of water required for growing grapes and the cost of electricity for the overall wine making process. Ari and Paloma have begun to explore the possibility of employing alternative sources of power and a more efficient irrigation system at the winery. Furthermore, they recently visited a neighbouring vineyard and were impressed with the environmentally friendly wine production techniques implemented by the owner. With the large number of visitors flocking to the city of Gramado each year, and wine consumers becoming increasingly environmentally aware, the Stopassolas feel they could make changes to the business to attract more visitors to the winery and sell more of their products to customers beyond the local area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,114.75,5.74,109.01,,,,28/02/2024 2:48,0000-00-00 00:00:00

You may choose a specific country and think about what it is like to be a child now or in the past. Alternatively, you may choose to focus on an earlier historical period in a westernised country. You must not focus on a childhood of the present time in a westernised country. • Perhaps you would like to focus on a particular historical event – the experience of being an evacuee or a child growing up in the blitz, a child escaping Nazi Germany or a modern day refugee. • You may focus on social class and describe the life of a wealthy child or one growing up in poverty but would need to give a broader context. • You may focus on education and describe a child attending a particular type of school – like McMillan’s open air nurseries, or a Montessori nursery. • Perhaps you are interested in looked after children and want to describe life in a children’s home, or a foster home in a particular period or the experience of being shipped to Canada or Australia as an orphan. • Perhaps family members have talked about their childhoods at length and you want to find out more about the events that surrounded their lives. • The creative text will encourage you to really think about what it is to live in different circumstances as you will need to focus on the realities of other times, places and social situations.

The assessment is in the form of a portfolio case study, totaling an equivalent word count of 2500 words Portfolio Case Study - Leading Development Change (2500 words/equivalent) You will use a case study to evidence your understanding of how to implement change management theory, whilst using the learning you have gained in this module to develop your knowledge and skills. You will apply change theory to your case study, to support a change that has to take place in an early year setting. This will be written in the first person as if you are the one making the change. You will thread through the case study reflection on your own skills. By completing and the audits found in course learning material – the Leadership Style survey and Body Language quiz as well as reflecting on the Belbin Team Roles and the High 5 Strengths Test, you should be able to learn more about yourself. Be honest when you answer and try and answer without thinking too hard, so you are using your innate knowledge to answer the questions. When you write your portfolio case study you will reflect on what you have learned about yourself. You will identify your strengths and your areas of development that will help you to become a better leader. This case study can be created in a creative way to fit your strengths, there is no particular form that it will take, think outside the box. You can include photographs or drawings or paintings that represent the models or the contexts you are describing. You should analyse the images with care, to discuss what they show (paying attention to visual details). There is help available online for breaking down images (Links to an external site.) and for analysis of images (Links to an external site.).

On the website, he needs to complete the missions and take screenshots of the most relevant parts and make a brief explanation underneath. To complete the missions, the writer will have to watch 35-40 videos (this was already discussed with the assistant of your website).

Your line manager who is your company’s CEO, with limited accounting background, is preparing a report for the Board meeting scheduled for 23 March 202X. He learnt that you are currently enrolled on the MSc Accounting & Finance programme at SOAS; he is aware that managerial accounting is a core module on this programme. You have received the following email from the CEO. To: M. A. Student From: Steve, CEO Date: 09-01-202X Subject: Transfer Pricing Hi Student, I am hoping you could give me advice in form of a report on transfer pricing to support my preparation for the forthcoming Board meeting. Please note the following: (i) The report must be comprehensive but limited to 2000 words. (ii) As the board meeting takes place quarterly, the report must reach me not later than 23:59 on 22 March 202X. (iii) The report should cover such aspects as the transfer pricing mechanisms as well as the strategic importance and risks associated with transfer pricing decisions. (iv) While you may include necessary calculations, these should be attached as appendix and must not be more than 10 per cent of the report. Best, Steve Note: Assume that your company is listed on the London Stock Exchange with international operations around the world. Also, while references are required, they do not count toward the 2000 words. The above are the guidelines given for the coursework assignment, which should be in the form of a report. The word count is 2000 words, and the appendices must be under 200 words. We could include the calculations as attachments. If they\'re done in Excel, I can import it and include it within the Appendix. The instructions for the scope of the report are quite vague, and it doesn\'t mention very clearly what must be included. I\'ve attached a draft document which I created with ChatGPT for reference. The company I chose is GSK, but you are free to choose any other company that you feel may be suited better. Also, you are not required to adhere to the structure/outline I\'ve put in. You may modify it completely, since the word count limit would probably not allow for it. I\'ve mentioned the references as 25, but the more the references the better. Even for the data in appendices, please include the references. Number of pages is also mentioned as 8 for the 2000 words, but it may go over while including references and appendices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,143.6,7.18,136.42,,,,02/03/2024 9:44,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Indeed, there are three interesting variations of company behaviour in the UK, in the context of the above question. (1) Some companies are keen to float on the London Stock exchange. A good example is EasyJet. Founded in 1995, the company was very ambitious, with a vision of becoming the largest low-cost airline, with flights between European cities. EasyJet shares were formally admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange on 22 November 2000 under the ticker EZJ. Today, the low-cost carrier EasyJet has established itself among the most significant airlines based in the UK by passenger numbers. The company is still trading on the London Stock Exchange, with a rising share price as at 25.01.24 19:08:14 GMT. (2) Some companies have de-listed from the London Stock Exchange. For example, Kingspan Group Plc announced that the listing of the Company\'s Ordinary Shares on the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority and admission to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange plc were cancelled with effect from 8.00 a.m. (Dublin time), 18 August 2023. (3) Some companies are content to raise equity finance privately, without being quoted on the London Stock Exchange. For example, a professor at Cambridge University became a millionaire by commercialising a speech recognition software in the early 1990s. The company did well and was eventually bought by Microsoft, without a stock market quotation at all. In this coursework assignment, you are asked to undertake a comprehensive search of publicly available information (e.g. online search from websites, the London Stock Exchange, Financial Times, The Economist, etc..) in order to identify, and present a report on at least 2 UK companies which best illustrate each of the above 3 categories, regarding the decision to float or not to float shares on the London Stock Exchange. The examples should refer to the period 2000-2024. Your coursework report should not exceed 2000 words (excl. references and appendix). Above are the guidelines for the coursework assignment in the Module International Corporate Finance. I\'m quite unclear as to what the calculations needed for valuation of the companies are. Some of my classmates are calculating the risk adjusted NPV, using a discount rate calculated using CAPM. I\'m unsure whether WACC or any other metrics need to be looked at for the scope of the paper, to rationalize the decisions of going public, delisting, or staying private/getting funding through private equity. The others are doing these calculations for each year (from 2000 to 2024 based on when the company was incorporated), using the company betas where available (or using the beta of a similar firm). They\'ve created graphs and tables from these calculations to use as a part of the analysis. I\'ll leave that to your discretion and professional judgement to suggest what works best for the scope of the paper. The companies I\'ve chosen are mentioned in the draft I have put in the attachments. I\'ve created this draft using ChatGPT so they have no references. You may choose to adhere to the same outline/structure or propose to do it any other way. I\'ve selected the number of references as 35, but please feel free to add more as required. The number of pages as well is selected as 8 for the 2000 words, but it may go over considering the references and the calculations we need to attach as appendices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,143.6,7.18,136.42,,,,02/03/2024 10:27,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Wine prices are influenced by a plethora of factors, from the grape variety to vineyard region. Let\'s unlock the potential within the data and toast to a successful exploration of wine pricing dynamics! Cheers! This assignment is part of the Applied Econometrics for Management and Finance module. It should be submitted in Microsoft Word document format. For this assignment, students should use the Stata econometrics program. Students should submit only one Word document containing their answers. Students should use the wine1.dta dataset to conduct the analysis. The dataset contains 1,022 observations and 32 variables. Please answer the following questions: 1. Prepare a table of descriptive statistics for the variables: Price, age, score and cases. Discuss. 2. Present a correlation table for the same variables. Discuss. 3. Estimate the following regression model that relates wine prices to years of aging, tasting score, cases produced and some popular varieties (i.e. merlot, pinot, shiraz) Log(Price) = β1+β2log(Age) + β3Score + β4Cases + β5Merlot + β6Pinot+ β7Shiraz+ et Tip! Before you estimate the models make sure to do all the necessary transformations in the variables. 4. Discuss the regression results. Tip! Students are expected to comment on the interpretation of the regression coefficients, statistical significances and goodness if fit. 5. Test the hypothesis “the price of the wine does not depend on the tasting score”. Can you suggest a reason for the test outcome? (Refer to Hedonic Model) Please also list the commands given to Stata to create the two tables and regression model, and also to test the hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,47.85,2.39,45.46,,,,02/03/2024 11:23,0000-00-00 00:00:00

By placing an order at www.theacademicpapers.co.uk, you are making an agreement with The Academic Papers UK. It is important for you to read our terms and conditions carefully. You should also understand that by placing an order at our website means that you agree with our terms and conditions. The Company acts as an agency that the customer appoints to get his/her order completed by an expert in the field. The Company is liable to get the order completed within the given time frame meeting all the requirements as provided by the Customer in the order form. The Company is entitled to refuse any order in case a suitable expert not available and in this case, the Company will refund any payment made by the Customer in respect of that order. In a case, if the customer is not satisfied, the Company will take necessary actions as described below in this agreement. 1 Order Process: 1.1: While placing an order with The Academic Papers UK, the customer will have to provide all the information like email, address, phone number accurately. Failure to provide the original details will result in canceling the contract which means canceling the order. 1.2: While placing the order, the customer needs to briefly describe the requirements of the paper and attach all the sources/documents which may be helpful for the writer to understand the topic. Furthermore, if the customer has library access then he/she can provide the library access details so that the writer may get any information required to complete the paper however providing library access is optional. The customer has the right to not disclose the library access details with us. In this case, the writer will get all the information related to the course himself. 1.3: The customer is required to pay the full amount for the order in advance. However, upon request from the customer and after mutual agreement, a custom discounted price link is generated (if available) else the customer is required to make full payment. 1.4: We prefer payment in full however there is an option for the customers to pay in two installments. For this purpose, a customer can discuss with our customer support representatives and pay accordingly. We offer our customers to pay only 2 installments. 1st installment will be paid instantly while placing an order while the 2nd installment will be paid after getting the first draft of the paper. 1.5: As soon as the company receives the payment from the customer, a writer is assigned to work on the paper of the customer. The Customer can ask any question directly from the writer. However in case if the customer is not satisfied with the writer then the customer may ask customer support representatives to change the writer and hence a new writer will be assigned to work on the paper of the customer. 1.6: Use of Samples for Quality Assurance: You will be asked to accept our Privacy Policy at a later stage. By accepting, you agree to allow us to use your order for quality assurance purposes. We only use a short abstract from your paper (not more than one page) to provide other clients with a work sample from their writer. The copy of the extract from your order is protected, so it cannot be copied or distributed. 2 Delivery of Service: 2.1: The company is liable to provide the services on time or even before the delivery deadline. However, in certain situations, which are not under the control of humans like a storm or any other disaster, providing us wrong email contact in the order form or any other issues like the customer has changed the writer or order requirements near the deadline then the order delivery can be late. Instead of all these issues, the customer will get his/her order on time. 2.2: Since we are operating 24/7, the deadline for submission includes weekends and national holidays (UK). This is to facilitate customers and fulfill our promise of service delivery i.e 24/7/365. 2.3: All the completed papers are sent via email ID provided by the customer in the order form after agreeing with terms and conditions. When the completed order is sent from us, the customer is responsible to download it as soon as possible. In some cases using spam filters or any other firewalls by the customer, the order appears in Spam or Junk emails. The customer needs to check from there. Any issues being occurred from the customer’s ISP, we will not be responsible and the customer will be billed. 2.4. Progressive Delivery Policy: At a later stage, you are given the option to request a Progressive Delivery feature. As this option indicates, you will receive your order in parts or sections. We deliver each part of your order on the agreed deadline and await your comments and approval. Deadlines for approval or revision of each part or section can vary between 24-72 hours. If you do not adhere to the timelines, the overall deadline for your final paper is automatically extended by the length of time delayed. By choosing the Progressive Delivery option, you confirm that you agree to stay in touch with your assigned writer and give guidance when necessary. You also agree to provide feedback and approve the parts of the order delivered to you within the agreed deadlines. You will also progressively approve the order to ensure your requirements are met at each stage of writing. Some limitations apply to the Progressive Delivery option: It does not apply to orders with deadlines from eight hours to three days and/or a total value of less than $200, but it is obligatory for papers with a deadline that exceeds or equals 7-10 days, with a total price over $600. You can select this option, if needed to contact us, for any other orders that do not fall under these limits. 3 Verification Process: 3.1: We use a third-party payment processor (Bluesnap). Sometimes their anti-fraud system rejects the order and payment received from the customer due to using location or IP which is suspected. 4 Quality Assurance Policy: 4.1: You have an option to request a work sample of the writer who is working on your order. There is a $5 charge for this service. A work sample contains three random pages previously completed by the writer. The system automatically generates all samples, so we cannot guarantee that they will only contain text and might contain, in addition, graphs, charts, images, statistics, calculations, or references. A work sample can be used only for quality assurance: it should not be copied or distributed. After your order is assigned to the writer, you have two hours to review the samples and request another writer if the samples tendered do not meet your expectations. We can change the writer at your request no more than three times on one order. 5 Revision Policy: 5.1: We work to provide the best services and provide guaranteed satisfaction to customers. To facilitate our customers, the company is liable to provide unlimited revisions of completed paper until 15 days of completion of the order. These revisions will be provided free of cost. 5.2: In case if the customer has not asked for any revision till 45 days after completion of the order then after 15 days, the customer will need to pay extra cost for revision. 5.3: It is important to note that the writer requires time to cater to a revision request according to its nature and requirements which may vary from 24 hours to 3 or 4 days. 5.4: The customer can also set a timeframe for revision as per his/her needs. 5.5: In case of the revision requires an additional word count than the original order or major changes, the writer may ask for payment accordingly. 6 Refund Terms and Conditions: 6.1: In case if the customer has made the payment twice due to server error or browsing issue or any other issue, The Academic Papers UK will issue a refund for one payment that was paid by mistake while the company will keep the other payment which is genuine and paid to buy its services. 6.2: The company will issue a full refund only if plagiarism is found over 30%. Please note that in such a case, you will need to provide us the Turnitin plagiarism check report. Without proof of plagiarism, it will not be accepted and no refund will be issued. 6.3: In case if you get a low quality (either it has a large amount of grammar or spelling mistakes or it has poor grammar structure), work is not done according to the requirements of the customer as described in the order form and it needs some modifications then we will revise the work. To facilitate more we can change the writer free of cost. If after getting the minimum 3 revisions, the quality issue remains the same then the company is liable to issue a partial refund of up to 30% however, to qualify for it, the customer needs to provide detailed feedback and proof. 6.4: In case if the customer has placed an order and the writer has not been assigned yet but the customer has opened a ticket to issue a refund then an 80% refund will be made. But however, during the work process, these terms and conditions will be applied. 6.5: In case if the writer has been assigned and an order assigning email has been initiated by the writer to the customer and the customer asks for a refund then a partial refund will be issued which will be a maximum of 70%. 6.6: If the writer has provided the customer with a draft of the paper and has proceeded to further work and then the customer asks for a refund, then the customer will be issued a partial refund of up to 50%. 6.7: In case if the writer has completed the paper but not sent it to the customer and the customer asks for a refund then only a 25% refund from the total cost will be issued. 6.8: After getting the completed work, the customer will not be able to ask refund besides the terms and conditions mentioned in 6.2 and 6.3 of the refund policy. 6.9: Those customers who placed an order for the 24 and 48 hours deadline, are not eligible for order cancellation and they will be only able to get a refund in such cases as mentioned above, 6.2 and 6.3 applies. 7 Money-Back Guarantee Our Money Back Guarantee gives you the right to request and receive a refund at any stage of your order, if anything goes wrong. This includes any possible problems you might encounter and secures your interests. Our company enjoys a high customer satisfaction rate, while refund requests are rare, which is partly due to our crystal-clear Money Back Guarantee. All refund requests are processed within 4-6 business days. 7.1: No Writer Was Found to Work on My Order: We always do our best to assign the most appropriate writer to work on your paper; however, it is still possible that on rare occasions the writer is not found. If this does occur, we issue a full refund and provide you with a discount code for your next order. If you request for the revision of the finished paper to be completed by a different writer, and a suitable one is not found, our Dispute Resolution Specialist reviews your claim and proceeds with an appropriate refund after you request it. 7.2: My Paper Was Late: If lateness occurs due to the late upload of extra materials on your part, you cannot apply for a lateness refund. Please make sure all paper details and additional materials are provided upon placing the order. If due to some other reason the first version of a paper is delivered after the original deadline, you can request a recalculation of the order price, according to the deadline for delivery. For example, an 8-hour delivery paper completed an hour late now falls into the 24-hour delivery category, and should cost less. The difference in price is refunded. If lateness occurs with a long-term order (11-14 days or longer) we refund 7% upon your request. If the first version of a paper is late and is not approved by you, you are eligible for a full refund and a discount for your next order as you might not need the paper anymore. 7.3: The Revision of My Paper Was Late: Lateness refunds and price recalculation do not apply to revisions, since revision deadlines are set separately. In order to avoid confusion, please make sure you choose the correct deadline when placing an order. Your final submission deadline should correspond to the date when your paper is due and should exceed your first draft deadline by at least 30%, so that we are given a leeway for any possible revisions of your order. 7.4: I Am Not Fully Satisfied With The Quality of The Paper. However, I Accept it, And Will Revise it Myself. I Request a Partial Refund. If you are not completely satisfied with the quality of the paper you receive, you may request a free revision, or ask for a different writer to be assigned to your order. Alternatively, you can request a partial refund by clicking the “Refund” button on your personal order page and choosing “I am not fully satisfied with the quality of the paper. However, I accept it and will revise it myself. I request a partial refund”. If you choose this option, you are automatically provided with the MS Word version of the paper. You then have 14 days to provide strong reasons and examples to back up your claim or your own revised version of our paper as supporting evidence. As soon as you do that, up to 40% could be refunded at the Dispute Department’s discretion. To request a partial refund after you have already approved the last version of your order, contact our support team in chat, over the phone, or through your personal order page for assistance. Failure to provide the information required for dispute resolution within 14 days results in cancellation of the dispute, after which no refund is possible. All partial refund requests should be submitted by asking “Customer Support Representatives”, who are always online 24/7. 7.5: I Am Completely Dissatisfied with The Quality of The Paper, So I Have Decided to Write it Myself. I Request a Full Refund. If you are completely dissatisfied with the quality of the paper you receive, you may request a free revision, or ask for a different writer to be assigned to your order. Alternatively, if you haven’t previously approved the paper, you can request a full refund. In case of a full refund request, the Company reserves the right to publish the paper online for commercial purposes. We do not keep any kind of essay databases, and “publish online” means that if the paper is googled, searched for in a search engine, or checked by any kind of anti-plagiarism software, it links back to our website. It may also be published as content or as a sample essay. This is done to protect our writer’s work in cases when a customer claims a refund after the work has been completed and used. Customers have the opportunity to review their orders and request additional corrections if necessary according to policies. However, once you have approved the paper, you cannot request a full refund. If you have at least once approved either the initial or the revised version of your paper by asking a customer support representative, you are only eligible for a partial refund. Please note that, although you are able to apply for a full refund for such types of services as editing, rewriting, proofreading, CV, cover letter, or resume, your paper will not be published online since it may contain your personal information. All full refund requests should be submitted through the “Customer Support Representatives” online 24/7 within 14 days from the time the paper is delivered. 7.6: I Would Like to Receive a Refund for an Additional Service/Feature 7.6.1: Progressive Delivery order: For orders using the Progressive Delivery feature, the deadline for a revision request is limited to 21 days after initial approval. Once you press the “Approve part” button in your Progressive Delivery and proceed to the next section of your order, you cannot request a refund for the previously approved part. You can receive a refund for only the last section of the order delivered to you. All parts of the order approved using the “Approve part” button become non-refundable once we start working on the next section. The 10% Progressive Delivery fee itself is non-refundable. 7.6.2: Samples Service: The $5 deposit for our Writer’s sample service is non-refundable, so please make sure you check the samples provided on time. If you fail to request a different writer within the given time, we regard it as acceptance of the writer initially assigned. 7.6.3: Editor’s Service: Please note that if you wish to receive a refund for the extra 30% editor’s service fee, you must request it as a partial refund using the “Refund” button on your personal order page. 7.6.4: Writer’s Category: If you pay the extra fee for an Advanced or ENL (English as a Native Language) writer, but we are unable to find one to work on your order at the time, and assign a writer with a lower category (such as Best Available) instead, the extra fee is refunded to you. 7.6.5: Discount Code: Please use your discount code upon placing a new order, we do not issue refunds for discounts and they may not be applied once you have paid for the order. 7.6.6: I Received My Completed Paper, But Forgot to Approve It: Please note you have 14 days to approve your order (or order the part for orders with Progressive Delivery feature). Time for approval is calculated automatically from the moment the last version is uploaded to your personal order page. If you fail to request a revision or to approve your order (or order the part) within 14 days, the paper is approved automatically by the system. From the moment the order is approved (by you or the system), you have 14 days to request a refund. After that, no refund request is possible. 8 Customer Validation Policy: 8.1: You have an option to request a work sample of the writer who is working on your order. There is a $5 charge for this service. A work sample contains three random pages previously completed by the writer. The system automatically generates all samples, so we cannot guarantee that they will only contain text and might contain, in addition, graphs, charts, images, statistics, calculations, or references. A work sample can be used only for quality assurance: it should not be copied or distributed. After your order is assigned to the writer, you have two hours to review the samples and request another writer if the samples tendered do not meet your expectations. We can change the writer at your request no more than three times on one order. 9 Chargeback Policy: 9.1: To minimise the rate of forced chargebacks, we have the right to verify the payment details and your identity. In case of any complaint that the customer has, the settlements will be made by the Q&A team of The Academic Papers UK. 9.2: The settlement for the issue between the customer and the company must be settled within 10 days of the customer’s complaint which will go through the Q&A team of the company. The customer needs to send proof regarding the matter so that the Q&A team may review it. 9.3: In case if the company fails to settle the dispute within 10 days then after 10 days, the customer is authorised to contact with bank or credit card company or his payment processor to file a dispute against the issue. 9.4: In case if the customer does not follow paragraph 8.1 of the chargeback terms and conditions and contacts directly with the bank, payment processor, or credit card company without getting the settlement through the Q&A team of the company then no chargeback will be issued. 10 Disclaimer Policy: The services provided by The Academic Papers UK are meant to assist the buyer by providing a guideline.

The only option I have to select which is somewhat close is civil engineering which is not ideal. I have also added the assignment, which has the comments made by the lecturer at the bottom of the document regarding the failed assignment. I have attached a coursework brief. The following is further explanation of the assignment. The writer will need to access the BCIS online data base to get the required data. For this coursework, risk allocations can be calculated in various manner. One option is to calculate the average % based on the number of projects (for example, if you have risk allocation only in 2 projects then find the average from those two projects rather than from all 4 projects). If you decide to use a probability multiplier here that is fine. The other option is to find a representative % from books and reports. The second approach seems more appropriate for design feed and risk allocations. Task 2 is about the costs in this coursework. WLCosting uses NPV related formula to calculate the whole life costs of the selected building. This task is to find the total cost rather than the profit. You can also use NPV to calculate the profit for investment options (in organisational management). In this coursework, task 3 is where you will decide on the profitability of the proposed project. The overall coursework word limit is 3000. However, there is not an expectation for any discussion or logical argument in Tasks 1, 2 and 3. You can use tables to summarise information (evidence) in these sections. The only section where we are marking an essay-type question is Task 4 which has a 1000 word limit. this is where there will be more consideration of the word limit as the assignment will need to be concise yet linked argument and recommendations for this proposal. So, please keep the overall word limit to 3000 words and the task 4 word limit to 1000 words. For tasks 1 and 3 you need to provide the information that led to the assumptions. For example, when you are calculating the average rental rates, within the main text you could provide a table that shows the rental rates of 4-5 similar buildings and the average that you would then go on to use in the GDV calculations. However, you need to evidence these properties from a property searching website (let\'s say Rightmove). the screenshot of these properties should go in the appendices. In short, information that led to the decision should go in the main text, and the evidence should go in the appendices.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/PE7007 Coursework Brief 23-24.pdf\"",\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Construction Economics Essay - W21046940.docx.pdf\""]",279,13.95,265.05,,,,03/03/2024 5:01,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Most Companies in The Academic Writing Industry DO NOT Offer a Specific Money Back Guarantee. They often tend not keep their promise to return your money if you are not satisfied with the order. At theacademicpapers.co.uk, we want you to FEEL SAFE when placing your order with us! Our Money Back Guarantee gives you the right to request and receive a refund at any stage of your order, if anything goes wrong. This includes any possible problems you might encounter, and secures your interests. Our company enjoys a high customer satisfaction rate, while refund requests are rare, which is partly due to our crystal-clear Money Back Guarantee. All refund requests are processed within 4-6 business days. 1 I Want to Cancel My Order: If you decide to cancel your order before we assign a writer to work on it, you receive a 100% refund. If a writer has already been assigned, and it is confirmed by order’s status bar at the top of your order page, the refund amount depends on your deadline. You can claim a 70% refund if half or less of the period has passed, and up to 50% thereafter. This is because the writer who starts on your assignment should receive the compensation for the work done. Please note that you cannot receive a refund for order cancellation if the paper has been completed and delivered to your order page on time. If the paper has been delivered within the deadline you stipulate and pay for, you can only request a refund due to quality concerns, through our customer support representatives. 2 I Paid for One Order Twice: If you notice that you were charged twice or more than price quote, and you receive two receipts from the payment processing system (that is, BlueSnap), do not hesitate to contact us. Forward both receipts to our customer support representatives and the extra payment will be refunded in full within the shortest possible time. 3 I Accidentally Placed Two Identical Orders: If you complete the payment for two identical orders by mistake, please contact us immediately to clarify the situation before we proceed with both orders. It is your responsibility to cancel any orders you do not need, before we assign a writer to work on them. Otherwise, they are regarded as regular orders and standard refund procedures apply (see *I want to cancel my order*). 4 No Writer Was Found to Work on My Order: We always do our best to assign the most appropriate writer to work on your paper; however, it is still possible that on rare occasions the writer is not found. If this does occur, we issue a full refund and provide you with a discount code for your next order. If you request for the revision of the finished paper to be completed by a different writer, and a suitable one is not found, our Dispute Resolution Specialist reviews your claim and proceeds with an appropriate refund after you request it. 5 My Paper Was Late: If lateness occurs due to the late upload of extra materials on your part, you cannot apply for a lateness refund. Please make sure all paper details and additional materials are provided upon placing the order. If due to some other reason the first version of a paper is delivered after the original deadline, you can request a recalculation of the order price, according to the deadline for delivery. For example, an 8-hour delivery paper completed an hour late now falls into the 24-hour delivery category, and should cost less. The difference in price is refunded. If lateness occurs with a long-term order (11-14 days or longer) we refund 7% upon your request. If the first version of a paper is late and is not approved by you, you are eligible for a full refund and a discount for your next order as you might not need the paper anymore. 6 The Revision of My Paper Was Late: Lateness refunds and price recalculation do not apply to revisions, since revision deadlines are set separately. In order to avoid confusion, please make sure you choose the correct deadline when placing an order. Your final submission deadline should correspond to the date when your paper is due and should exceed your first draft deadline by at least 30%, so that we are given a leeway for any possible revisions of your order. 7 Progressive Delivery order: For orders using the Progressive Delivery feature, the deadline for a revision request is limited to 21 days after initial approval. Once you press the “Approve part” button in your Progressive Delivery and proceed to the next section of your order, you cannot request a refund for the previously approved part. You can receive a refund for only the last section of the order delivered to you. All parts of the order approved using the “Approve part” button become non-refundable once we start working on the next section. The 10% Progressive Delivery fee itself is non-refundable. 8 Samples Service: The $5 deposit for our Writer’s sample service is non-refundable, so please make sure you check the samples provided on time. If you fail to request a different writer within the given time, we regard it as acceptance of the writer initially assigned. 9 Editor\'s Service: Please note that if you wish to receive a refund for the extra 30% editor’s service fee, you must request it as a partial refund using the “Refund” button on your personal order page. 10 Writer\'s Category: If you pay the extra fee for an Advanced or ENL (English as a Native Language) writer, but we are unable to find one to work on your order at the time, and assign a writer with a lower category (such as Best Available) instead, the extra fee is refunded to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240302_123400.jpg\"",\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/20240302_123411.jpg\""]",65.85,3.29,62.56,,,,03/03/2024 12:29,0000-00-00 00:00:00

What might such a framework look like and how might it impact on the practice of mediation in the UK? For the purposes of the assessment, word count is defined as the number of words contained in the submitted work including quotations, titles, abstracts, summaries and tables of contents. Footnotes, appendices and bibliographies are not included in the word count. Appendices will not normally be marked and they must not include material essential to the argument developed in the main body of the work. (OSCOLA) Module Overview The main aim of this module is to offer a critical analysis of the theoretical and practical discourse of dispute processes in comparative perspective. The module considers a range of issues and materials relating to the development of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and current debates on civil justice reform in selected jurisdictions. The module first examines the emergent concern in social science and jurisprudential writing with the nature and significance of disputes, and considers the manner in which traditional approaches have been “rediscovered‟ and utilised in the refurbishment of civil justice through first the “Access to Justice‟ movement and then the “ADR‟ movement. The module also investigates the manner in which disputes are characterised, the diverse views located in the debates that surround disputes, the causes of disputes, and the handling of disputes. It introduces the major theoretical approaches to disputes and their resolution, and examines the decision making processes used in response to disputes. In particular, the module examines negotiation, and mediation, and considers these processes as they are applied in a range of settings. It is informed by the view that knowledge of the differing processes of dispute resolution and the surrounding discourses is an invaluable subject matter of academic enquiry. In addition, such knowledge enables lawyers and others to be more resourceful and effective in their legal problem solving. By the end of the module, students will have gained an understanding of the theoretical and practical dimensions of dispute resolution, and the groundwork laid for further inquiry into and application of non-adversarial methods and skills in dispute resolution. In particular, through practical experience in simulated exercises, students will gain an understanding of the dynamics of mediation and negotiation and the necessary skill of the mediator. Objectives and learning outcomes: • Understanding of theoretical and practical issues surrounding the differing processes of dispute resolution; • Knowledge and understanding of the core literature relating to the areas studied on the module, an in particular negotiation and mediation; • Basic ADR skills and practice experience that improve understanding of issues of ADR in legal practice.

Your Bibliography should be on a separate page and have separate categories for the different types of materials eg books, cases, internet sources. Module Overview: The module deals with the Actors, Norms, Institutions, Market-led Processes and Legal Conflicts in transnational law. Case studies, taken out of legal practice in financial, technological, and socio-legal contexts, provide an opportunity to explore complex, border-crossing problems that involve jurisdictions and transnational legal developments originating in the Global South and beyond (the Middle East, Afghanistan, Africa and the United Kingdom). Case studies illustrate concrete legal problems, patterns or trends in transnational law such as: the degree to which established legal fields have begun to change or develop under the influence of hybrid norm creation and the private law conflicts which can arise; the intersection of public and private law; global regulatory dynamics and distributional trade-offs; technological diffusion and regulation; the transnational legal implications of non-state actors such as international standard setting organisations as well as multinational corporations; the offshoring/onshoring of law; the transnational normative orders which facilitate informal value transfer systems (informal finance). The module has two aims. First, it provides students with the opportunity to engage with the research concerning the intersection of transnational law, finance, and technology. The module helps students to develop methodological toolkits for engaging with transnational law, grounded in comparative, sociolegal, and law and economics methodologies. Second, the module examines the legal conflicts and regulatory developments which arise in transnational financial and technological contexts. The module seeks to understand law as it originates, operates, influences and is influenced by finance, technology, and the social embeddedness of exchange. The module introduces an interdisciplinary approach to the study of law that considers the full scale of normativity and sanctioning patterns including norms, customs, institutions, market forces, code, and the law. This normative approach interrogates the assumption of the primacy of state-law and considers the problems and legal impact of sanctioning patterns at work in financial and technological contexts. Objectives and learning outcomes of the module On successful completion of this module a student will be able to: • Analyse, describe, and critique ‘transnational law’ and/or evaluate and explain transnational law in a financial or technological context. • Demonstrate understanding of the various methodologies involved in the analysis of transnational law in finance and technological contexts. • Demonstrate understanding of the module’s case studies of transnational legal practice in finance and technology contexts. • Critically assess transnational regulatory conflicts and developments in finance and technology. • Demonstrate and critically assess transnational lawmaking and diffusion in financial and technological contexts. • Demonstrate understanding of the full range of sanctioning patterns including norms, customs, institutions, market forces, code and the law and their relevance to the regulation of finance and technology.

Sources should be cited in accordance with a recognised academic referencing system (e.g. OSCOLA). You should draw on sources (e.g. cases, treaties, academic commentary etc) to write your coursework, but you also need to undertake independent research - using online databases such as Westlaw, Lexis, Heinonline or Jstor, and materials from the library. Module Overview This module provides a comprehensive, interdisciplinary study of the social issues raised by the cross-border operations of multinational enterprises (MNEs), as well as the regulatory frameworks at national, multilateral and international levels designed to address these issues. This includes consideration of the limits imposed on regulatory responses by the specific character of the business and legal organisation of MNEs and the regulatory choices open to policy makers. In this regard, the module Multinationals and the Law I studied in term 1 provides a foundation upon which this module expands. Together, the two modules offer grounding in different aspects of national and international law and will enhance understanding of the interface between commercial and public interest aspects of the law. The focus of this model is on the social dimension of the operations of MNEs in relation to areas such as access to justice, corporate governance, business and human rights, the environment and the regulation of the transnational space by international organisations. The comprehensive, interdisciplinary character of the module means that it provides a legal overview in which each aspect of the regulatory matrix is linked to and flows from the rest as well as from the topics covered in Multinationals and the Law I studied in term 1. The interface between the different aspects of the module enables connections to be made and information to be drawn from the different issues covered by the module so that they may be brought together in the context of, for example, the chosen essay topic.

Abstract is; The findings of this research demonstrates that loss aversion can result in asset overvaluation, a tenacious reluctance to sell properties during downturns in the economy, and a cautious approach to pursuing new investment opportunities. These suggestions range from behavioural nudges and educational studies to legislative frameworks, all aimed at balancing the influence of loss aversion. It is designed to provide readers a thorough understanding of the importance of the study and its contributions to the larger conversation on real estate decision-making and behavioural economics.

You have made a good start to the project; however, there are some improvements needed to each of the chapters. Introduction: You need to be more specific in your project topic and research questions. It is not enough to do a general project on digital transformation - you need to be looking more specifically at DT and supply chain management for a specific industry. You mention manufacturing, but that is still too broad. What exactly is being manufactured and how will DT relate to that? To clearly define the type of business who would be interested in your work, you need to provide a more detailed description of that type of business in the introduction. At the end of the report, you can make some general recommendations applicable to all manufacturers, but you will be expected to have some specific recommendations for businesses in the one specific market you have selected to improve their operations. The introduction should be about 1,000 to 1,500 words in the final report. Literature Review: You have made a good start to the literature review. However, more work will be needed to expand this chapter. I recommend you start with a more general overview of the technology adoption literature - both technology adoption in general and tech adoption in business and tech adoption in manufacturing. After writing 1,000 to 1,500 words on the general tech adoption literature, you can describe DT and supply chain management more specifically. The literature review should be about 3,000 words in the final report and review a minimum of 50 academic journal articles. A minimum of 60 articles is required if you are aiming for a distinction grade. Methodology: The methodology chapter needs to be expanded. For Philosophy and Approach, you should write two full paragraphs each. The first paragraph should explain what your selection is, and the second should explain why it is the most appropriate selection. Strategy, Choice, and Time Horizon can be one paragraph each. The final Methods layer should describe both your data collection technique and the tools, methods, or models you will use to analyze the data. The methodology chapter should be 1,000 to 1,500 words in the final report and include references to support your discussions. Please see the attached file for further comments. You should now begin to work on your final report. Please do not make any further changes to the project proposal. Please save a copy of the original project proposal (i.e. without comments) and include it as an appendix to the final report. Please make the changes noted above to the Introduction and use your new Introduction as the first chapter of your report. Please make the changes and additions noted for the literature review and use the updated literature review in your final report. Please make the changes noted for the methodology and use the updated methodology as the third chapter of your report. Please also begin to work on the fourth chapter – Results/Analysis. Please ensure that the fourth chapter addresses each of your research questions. After you have completed all four chapters, please conclude your report with a fifth chapter making recommendations based on your work. If you would like me to review your final report before submission, please send it to me by 15 April. Please note that I can review up to 20% (2,000 words of your final report), so please indicate which section you would like to be reviewed.

At the end of the report, you can make some general recommendations applicable to all manufacturers, but you will be expected to have some specific recommendations for businesses in the one specific market you have selected to improve their operations. The introduction should be about 1,000 to 1,500 words in the final report. Literature Review: You have made a good start to the literature review. However, more work will be needed to expand this chapter. I recommend you start with a more general overview of the technology adoption literature - both technology adoption in general and tech adoption in business and tech adoption in manufacturing. After writing 1,000 to 1,500 words on the general tech adoption literature, you can describe DT and supply chain management more specifically. The literature review should be about 3,000 words in the final report and review a minimum of 50 academic journal articles. A minimum of 60 articles is required if you are aiming for a distinction grade. Methodology: The methodology chapter needs to be expanded. For Philosophy and Approach, you should write two full paragraphs each. The first paragraph should explain what your selection is, and the second should explain why it is the most appropriate selection. Strategy, Choice, and Time Horizon can be one paragraph each. The final Methods layer should describe both your data collection technique and the tools, methods, or models you will use to analyze the data. The methodology chapter should be 1,000 to 1,500 words in the final report and include references to support your discussions. Please see the attached file for further comments. You should now begin to work on your final report. Please do not make any further changes to the project proposal. Please save a copy of the original project proposal (i.e. without comments) and include it as an appendix to the final report. Please make the changes noted above to the Introduction and use your new Introduction as the first chapter of your report. Please make the changes and additions noted for the literature review and use the updated literature review in your final report. Please make the changes noted for the methodology and use the updated methodology as the third chapter of your report. Please also begin to work on the fourth chapter – Results/Analysis. Please ensure that the fourth chapter addresses each of your research questions. After you have completed all four chapters, please conclude your report with a fifth chapter making recommendations based on your work. If you would like me to review your final report before submission, please send it to me by 15 April. Please note that I can review up to 20% (2,000 words of your final report), so please indicate which section you would like to be reviewed.

This concept has been perceived as a personality trait that it was constructed and stable over time (Campbell et all., 1996; Wu et al., 2010). However, recent research states that self-concept clarity may be malleable (Adam et al., 2018). For example, different experiences in life, such as changing job, becoming a parent or living in a different country might change the SCC of individuals (Adam et al., 2018). One way individuals make a sense of themselves is by self-perception, such as the way they behave or think (You et al., 2009); and by others views (Oczlon et al., 2021). Therefore, by being a foreigner, individuals expose themselves to a different environment, with different values and beliefs, thus this change might make a difference in their SCC. Thus, this research will focus on how SCC can be changed when being a foreigner. Two research questions that it will try to explore will be: how implicit social feedback and how one makes sense of it influence SCC; and how moving to a different country help individuals form a different identity of themselves and therefore, change their SCC. In order to answer these questions, semi-structure interviews will be carried. The participants will be 6 volunteers, over 18 years old, that will be recruit by social media.

Caroline attended a meeting with Sam of This is Forever Ltd. During the meeting Sam stated that the restaurant is very profitable as it is very close to 3 caravan sites with over 200 caravans sited on them. Sam also informs Caroline that the restaurant is licensed to hold weddings and that this is also profitable for them. Sam states that the annual profits are over £100,000. Sam provided Caroline with a set of accounts, however, Caroline noted that she is not good with numbers and would not be able to understand them. Due to this, Caroline sends these accounts to her paid business advisor who corroborates the figures. Caroline purchases the restaurant, however, the profits are much lower than were stated. It transpired that shortly after the meeting between Caroline and Sam, but before the contract was entered into, the restaurant lost its wedding license and as a result is no longer able to host wedding ceremonies. In addition two of the caravan sites have closed. Caroline has come to you for advice feeling that she is the victim of a misrepresentation. Advise Caroline. 1.

It usually helps to end the introduction with a paragraph or section on \'The Present Study\' (you may even separate this out with a sub-heading) which spells out what you intend to do in your study and why. This section should make clear to the reader the point of your piece of work, and the logic behind the design of your study, and springboard them into the Methods. Overall what the project is about: Ganzfeld- A widely-used experimental design in Parapsychology: In a noise-reduced environment surrounded by red light, participants are asked to verbally introspect, recorded as “mentations”, to predict a target clip amongst 3 decoys. \""hit and miss\"" thing is impornatnt to explain as then z-sores of this will be used in analysis. - An established link between psi and creativity [1,5], showing that certain types of artists like musicians may perform better than others in precognition. - Although mentations are core to the Ganzfeld, only one study has qualitatively analysed their contents, finding common use of visual (“I see”) and cognitive (“I think”) markers [6]. 1. Pre-collected data (N=180 participants selected for self-reported creativity): precognition task performance; mentation recordings; 2 validated questionnaires: ICAA: Creative Activity (CAct) and Creative Achievement (CAch) across 8 different domains (e.g., visual arts, writing, music, etc.) [2] RIBS: Broad level/amount of creativity [4] 2. Mentations transcribed and analysed using LIWC software [3], targeting perceptual & cognitive processes. 3. Calculated z-scores for each clip rating. - Explore the relationship between individuals’ types and amount of creativity, and their styles of introspection (mentations), focusing on sensory (e.g., “see”, “feel”, “hear”) and cognitive (e.g., “think”) markers. Test whether certain types of creativity are linked to higher z-scores. 1. Dalton, K. S. (1997).

Individual difference correlates of psi performance in forced-choice precognition experiments: A meta-analysis (1945-2016) - The Ganzfeld experiment is a notable and contentious paradigm in Parapsychology, aiming to study phenomena such as ESP and PK. - Research since the 1986 Joint Communique by Hyman and Honorton has sought to standardize Ganzfeld studies to assess psi and its mechanisms. - Psi encompasses ESP (extrasensory perception) and PK (psychokinesis), with limited process-oriented research examining underlying mechanisms. - Selected participants, typically characterized by belief in psi, practice of mental disciplines, and creativity, have been used in Ganzfeld research, showing mixed results. - Meta-analyses have found correlations between selected participants and psi results, particularly in performing arts students, but these findings have not been consistently replicated. - Recent studies control for sensory leakage and use precognition designs with individual participants, showing promising hit-rates. - Creativity in Ganzfeld research is defined differently from conventional definitions, and operationalizing it objectively remains a challenge. - Only limited research has analyzed the style of mentations (verbal reports) in Ganzfeld experiments, with findings suggesting differences between visual and cognitive individuals. - This research aims to explore the relationship between types of creativity and the style of mentations in the Ganzfeld, with implications for both Parapsychology and broader psychology fields. Research on the subject, such as the exploration of anomalous perception in a Ganzfeld condition, highlights the potential for selected participants to exhibit significantly different outcomes compared to non-selected participants, suggesting that the Ganzfeld method might be particularly conducive to eliciting psi phenomena among individuals with specific predispositions (Tressoldi & Storm, 2021). Additionally, studies examining the relationship between psi performance and individual difference factors, like personality traits or belief in psi, indicate that these factors may play a significant role in the manifestation of psi abilities, further supporting the argument for the selective use of participants in psi research (Zdrenka & Wilson, 2017). This study extends prior research in five significant aspects: Firstly, it delves into uncharted territory by examining the correlation between various forms of creativity and the manner of mentations in the Ganzfeld. This exploration remains unprecedented and holds relevance not only for process-oriented Parapsychology but also for broader areas of Psychology, shedding light on the nexus between creativity and individual imaginative processes. Success in psi studies is closely tied to creativity, prompting the current suggestion to use selected participants in new psi research. Ganzfeld, a well-respected measure in parapsychology, becomes even more reliable when applied to participants selected for their previous psi experience, mental discipline practices, and creative/artistic abilities. Some experiments suggest that certain kinds of creativity are linked to psi, adding an extra layer to the exploration of the connection between creativity and extrasensory perception. Need to explain what motivates your study – while previous studies have selected or recommended use of ‘creative’ participants, ‘creative/artistic’ has usually been loosely defined by the researchers and no formal measures of creativity have been taken (Dalton is the exception). The mentation is the route through which the participant/independent judge identifies connections with the ganzfeld targets; but little is known about how/if different types of creativity may manifest in the style of the mentation. While you are not going to be testing whether there is a link between creativity and psi task performance, your dissertation is trying to provide parapsychologists with information about how different creative types report their mentation. The implicit assumption seems to be that creative = artistic, however creativity may manifest in other domains/activities. ICAA gives an idea of different domains (think of it like a demographic measure, describing the participants’ creative ‘profile’; RIBS gives idea of creative ideation (think of it like a general measure of creative ability). - The study aims to measure the amount and type of creativity in individuals using LIWC software. - It will explore the relationship between creativity levels/types and mentation (thought processes) types. - The study investigates a potential link between creativity and paranormal belief, specifically the tendency to perceive meaningful coincidences in random patterns. - Previous research by Rominger (2022) indicates an association between creativity and a higher propensity to link unrelated events or words. - Despite the established connection, no studies have yet explored how paranormal belief interacts with different types of creativity. - Creativity is broadly defined as forming new combinations of elements that are either specifically required or useful in some way (Mednick, 1962). - Creativity is applicable across various domains, including visual arts, music, performing arts, and cooking. - Types of creativity have been associated with paranormal experiences (Holt, 2004), which might influence both paranormal belief and mentation styles. - Research within the ganzfeld experiments context suggests there are notable differences in mentation styles, particularly between visual (\""I see\"") and cognitive (\""I think\"") processes. Researchers have long debated the definition of creativity (e.g. Sternberg & Lubart, 1999; Runco & Jaeger, 2012; Walia, 2019), with one widely accepted approach involving two key components: originality and effectiveness. For an idea to be seen as original it must be novel or unusual, whereas to be effective it needs to be useful or relevant to the task at hand. Categories used in LIWC to create the correlation atrix are: Perceptual Processes: see, touch, listen Seeing view, saw, look Hearing heard, listen, sound Feeling touch, hold, felt and analytic, insight and tentative. (it can be easily explained by the LIWC document, which explains everything about how it works etc). I am attaching plenty of the notes, copy pastes etc, so they can be used as information. I have no clue how to properly structure it, hence first paragraph explains what is expected to be included in this piece. If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me.

It usually helps to end the introduction with a paragraph or section on \\\'The Present Study\\\' (you may even separate this out with a sub-heading) which spells out what you intend to do in your study and why. This section should make clear to the reader the point of your piece of work, and the logic behind the design of your study, and springboard them into the Methods. Overall what the project is about: Ganzfeld- A widely-used experimental design in Parapsychology: In a noise-reduced environment surrounded by red light, participants are asked to verbally introspect, recorded as “mentations”, to predict a target clip amongst 3 decoys. \\\""hit and miss\\\"" thing is impornatnt to explain as then z-sores of this will be used in analysis. Research questions: Do ICAA and RIBS creativity scores correlate with mentation styles? Does creativity correlate positively with PSI results? - An established link between psi and creativity [1,5], showing that certain types of artists like musicians may perform better than others in precognition. - Although mentations are core to the Ganzfeld, only one study has qualitatively analysed their contents, finding common use of visual (“I see”) and cognitive (“I think”) markers [6]. 1. Pre-collected data (N=180 participants selected for self-reported creativity): precognition task performance; mentation recordings; 2 validated questionnaires: ICAA: Creative Activity (CAct) and Creative Achievement (CAch) across 8 different domains (e.g., visual arts, writing, music, etc.) [2] RIBS: Broad level/amount of creativity [4] 2. Mentations transcribed and analysed using LIWC software [3], targeting perceptual & cognitive processes. 3. Calculated z-scores for each clip rating. - Explore the relationship between individuals’ types and amount of creativity, and their styles of introspection (mentations), focusing on sensory (e.g., “see”, “feel”, “hear”) and cognitive (e.g., “think”) markers. Test whether certain types of creativity are linked to higher z-scores. 1. Dalton, K. S. (1997).

(1996). Riding the waves of commerce: A test of Trompenaars “model” of national culture International journal of intercultural relations 20(2), 189–198. Particularistic cultures • Exceptions to the rules are not only tolerated, but expected • While rules and laws are important, they often require flexibility in their application or enforcement by influential people (e.g., parents, peers, superiors, government officials) or unique circumstances Decisions often based on subjective criteria (e.g., hunches, personal connections) Gelfand et al.: Tight vs. Loose Cultures Tight cultures • Strong social norms • Low tolerance for deviant behaviour Tightness–looseness is influenced by: • Ecological/historical threats (population density, resource scarcity, conflict) • Societal institutions (autocracy, media regulations) Psychological affordances (need for structure) Collectivism in the GLOBE Institutional Collectivism • Degree to which organisational and institutional practices encourage and reward collective distribution of resources and collective action. • High: Group loyalty is more important than individual goals, acceptance, and cohesion in the collective is important. • Japan Greece In-Group Collectivism • Degree to which individuals express pride, loyalty, interdependence, and cohesiveness with their work team or family. • High: People take pride in the accomplishments of their family or team members. China, India Sweden, NZ Assertiveness and Gender in the GLOBE Assertiveness • Degree to which people are assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in social relationships. • High: Respect the strong, value competition, success, direct communication, high performance. • Have sympathy for the weak, value cooperation, speak indirectly. • Germany, US Thailand Gender Egalitarianism • Degree to which a society minimises gender role differences and promotes gender equality • High: More women in the workforce and in higher positions; M and F education similar • Low: Fewer women in workforce, smaller role in decision making, less education among women, more occupational sex segregation Denmark, Sweden Egypt, Turkey Humane Orientation • Degree to which society encourages and rewards people for being fair, altruistic, friendly, generous, caring, and kind. • High: Others are important. E.g., Philippines, Ireland, Malaysia, Thailand, Egypt, Mexico, Denmark Low: Self-interest is important. E.g., Germany, Spain, France, Greece, Poland Performance Orientation • Degree to which society encourages and rewards innovation, high standards, performance improvement, and excellence. • High: value training and development, reward performance, value effort and initiative, sense of urgency, can do attitude. • Switzerland, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Korea, US • Low: value loyalty, cooperation, age, experience, tradition.

Russia, Greece, Argentina Communication allows leaders to influence followers Personal appeals Reminding your target of your personal relationship with him/her (i.e., loyalty and/or friendship) Exchange Evoking reciprocity norms Coalition tactics Getting support from others Pressure Demanding or threatening Legitimating tactics Claiming a position of authority Rational persuasion Using facts and logic to argue your position Inspirational appeals Appealing to your target’s values, ideals, and/or goals ConsultationRhetoric and Delivery Why are body language and voice so important? • Together, they contribute to 93% of communication, and are particularly important for communicating feelings and attitudes • They contribute to the liking of the communicator (Mehrabian, 1971) and liking is a principle of persuasion (Cialdini, 2001) Getting other people involved Ingratiation Agreeing with your target and/or pointing out similarities; ‘sucking up’ Charismatic leaders are communication experts • Express emotions • Adopt a confident demeanor • Use of verbal imagery and metaphors • Charismatic U.S. Presidents used twice as many as non-charismatic Presidents (Mio et al., 2005) Ability to tailor language to the audience (Bligh & Hess, 2007) Overcoming bias •Be aware of your own biases • Be open to being wrong • Implicit Association Test •Analyze your judgements • In individualistic countries, people will typically make a dispositional attribution first • They will consider the situation only if they are: • Motivated • Able •Make blind judgements • E.g., orchestra auditions, grading •Collective decision-making • Include multiple, independent decision-makers •Don’t always rely on your gut • Rely on objective data to assess performance Cross-cultural differences in attributions • Western Cultures (individualistic; personal concerns prioritised) more often evince the Fundamental Attribution Error. • Eastern cultures (collectivist; sees groups as cohesive and agentic) are more likely to stereotype individuals based on group membership. Self-serving bias is relatively absent in Japan (Kitayama, Takagi, & Matsumoto, 1995), replaced by self-critical bias Attribution Theory As naïve scientists, we collect data before reaching a conclusion • Covariation Principle (Kelley, 1967) describes how we attribute a person’s behaviour to either internal (their disposition) or external factors (the situation) • Need three types of information: Consistency: Target behaves that way repeatedly in same situation • Distinctiveness: Target behaves that way across different situations • Consensus: Other people also behave that way Ethnocentrism Evaluation of other cultures according to preconceptions originating from the standards and customs of one’s own culture Stereotyping •Tendency to simplify complex life experiences by categorizing and generalizing • We categorize information to make our world more predictable •Stereotypes can enable us to respond rapidly to situations because of our pre-existing beliefs A tendency for efficiency Cognitive Misers • Use heuristics (shortcuts, rules of thumb) to make judgements • Or maybe because too little time/motivation and too much information (“cognitive load”) Naïve Scientists • We construct causal theories of human behaviour because we need to predict and control our environment • And because we feel our own behaviour is motivated, not random “Why did he/she do that?” Perception • Process by which we select, organize, and interpret sensory information • Helps us to make sense of the world; what we see, hear, touch, smell, taste People’s behaviours are based on their perceptions of what realty is, NOT on reality itself section 2: The future of work (is now) Over the past two decades, many organisations implemented flexible working arrangements: • Flexible working • Flexitime • Flexplace Becoming completely “officeless” What are the benefits of flexible working? What are the disadvantages? Benefits of flexible work for employees • Greater work-life balance • Spatial mobility • Increased work autonomy • Increased work motivation (due to greater autonomy) • Increased job satisfaction • Greater worker well-being (e.g., more positive mood, and reduced sickness absence) • Economic advantages (e.g., reduced costs associated with commuting, food, clothing, etc.) Benefits of flexible work for employers •Increased work morale and commitment •Economic advantages •Performance and productivity gains •Increased agility (access to work-related information regardless of time and space) •Increased diversity in teams •Improved ability to recruit and retain staff (employer branding) •Reduced staff turnover Disadvantages of virtual working Technical / contextual • Sometimes require complex technological applications • Lack of knowledge and/or skepticism among senior, mature managers concerning advanced ICT generally • Not suitable for every organisation due to operational environment Psychological • Increased home-to-work conflict • Increased role ambiguity • Perceived lack of promotion opportunities • Reduced support and feedback when working from home • Lack of social connection and increased feelings of professional isolation • Risk for injuries (e.g., ergonomic workstation setup, protocols to avoid electrical and trip hazards) • Lower levels of psychological detachment (“switching off”) from work • The autonomy paradox What are virtual teams? A virtual team—also known as a remote, dispersed, or distributed team—is commonly defined as: “an interdependent group of people working toward a common goal but separated by a number of boundaries, such as those of space, time, culture, or organisational affiliation.” Why go virtual? • Enables organisations to become agile, flexible, and compete in the global marketplace (Jungalwalla, 2000) • Can more easily leverage expertise and perspectives from different cultures • Enables work across geographical, cultural, contextual, and temporal boundaries Allows organisations to take advantage of the pool of global talent Challenges of virtual teams • Difficulties in developing and maintaining trust among team members • Lack of team cohesion in diverse teams (harder to develop a shared identity) • Social loafing—when team members exert less effort because they know their individual efforts cannot be evaluated and thus believe their contributions are unlikely to be rewarded • Difficulties in communicating and sharing knowledge across the boundaries of time and space • Lack of contextual social cues for proper interpretation Challenges of virtual teams Media Richness Theory • Communication mediums vary in their capacity to convey information effectively • Rich mediums provide • Immediate feedback • Availability of multiple cues • Ability to personalise messages • No direct positive relation with virtual team performance (Walvoord et al., 2008); therefore... Task-Media Fit Model • Tasks and communication medium can be matched based on information richness requirement Strategies for managing virtual teams • Role clarity is paramount: • Ensure the team has clear expectations around duties, responsibilities, and tasks of each team member • Encourage team members to share information about their tasks and responsibilities to increase transparency • Promote psychological safety and an open environment: • Assumptions can lead to misunderstandings (‘no stupid questions’) • Open-door office hours • Pay greater attention to team composition (Hoch & Dulebohn, 2017): • Conscientiousness: more likely to engage in important task-related behaviours (e.g., setting goals, providing feedback) • Openness to experience: more adaptable and responsive to changes in dynamic virtual team environments • Agreeableness: helpful to maintain team unity and cohesiveness in a virtual environment Effective leadership styles in the flexible working context Situational leadership • Adapt style context, organizational needs, and readiness of subordinates Transformational leadership • Leaders rely on charisma to motivate employees through regular communication, while showing concern and awareness for individual needs Empowering leadership • Sharing power with employees raising their autonomy and responsibility. More sustainable than directive leadership in the long run. Shared leadership • Virtual leaders should foster shared leadership among their team members, which enhances their team’s self-management ability (Hoch & Kozlowski, 2014) Causes of discrimination •Individual level: • Stereotyping (conscious AND unconscious) •Group level: • Social identity and social categorisation processes •Organisational level: • Culture, leadership, HR practices Effects of discrimination Individual level • Negative effect on mental well-being (Schmidt et al., 2014) • Negative effect on physical health (e.g., blood pressure; Broman, 1996) • Negative work attitudes (Ragins & Cornwell, 2001) • Reduced organizational citizenship behavior and job performance (Goldman, Gutek, Stein, & Lewis, 2006) Organisational level • Lawsuit and discrimination claims • Reputational costs (Karpoff & Lott, 1993) Lower perception of CSR (Singh & Point, 2004) Reducing prejudice: Contact Theory • Allport’s contact hypothesis (1954) • Contact among people/groups can reduce prejudice • Meta-analytic research shows a meaningful effect of contact (e.g., Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) • Reduces anxiety, increases self- disclosure, and increases trust (Hodson & Hewstone, 2013) The servant leader • Counter-intuitive approach to leadership: • De-emphasises glorification of the leader in favour of behaviours that focus on follower development and well-being (Hale & Fields, 2007). • Leaders’ primary goal is to provide a service to their follower • E.g., “How can I help you do your job better?” • Servant leadership core dimensions • Empowering and developing people • Humility • Authenticity • Interpersonal acceptance • Providing direction and stewardship Uniquely predicts citizenship, core performance and organisational commitment, above and beyond transformational leadership Group performance = synergy vs. process losses • Synergy • the whole is more than the sum of its parts. Groups can outperform the average individual performance of their members, and sometimes even outperform the best individual member. • Process Losses • Defined: in groups, any action, operation, or dynamic that prevents the group from reaching its full potential inefficiency, wasted time, poor communication, poor decisions, reduced effort (social loafing), inadequate coordination of effort (coordination loss), and too much conflict can occur when the group process is not well- managed or group is too large. Culture’s influence on teams • Cultural Norms • Orientations of the specific cultures that the members bring to the group • Cultural Diversity • Number of different cultures represented in the group • Relative Cultural Distance Extent to which group members are culturally different from each other Types of Diversity in Teams • Homogeneous Teams • Token Teams • Bicultural Teams • susceptible to in-group and out-group division Multicultural Teams Perspectives on team diversity • Social categorization theory (“pessimistic” view) • We label ourselves and others based on salient social categories • “Them and us” view: out group members judged via stereotypes • Similarity attraction paradigm (“pessimistic” view) • “Birds of a feather flock together” • Information/decision-making perspective (“optimistic” view) Different backgrounds, networks, information, and skills lead to better group performance if well managed Team diversity and innovation •Deep diversity (job-relevant) • Slight positive effect on team innovation • Members with different skills, experiences, tenure, education, and expertise can help solve complex problems and promote divergent thinking •Surface diversity (non-job-relevant) • Slight negative effect on team innovation • Due to communication problems and difficulties resolving conflict/accepting opposing views •Leadership likely plays a crucial role Get team members to value opposing viewpoints • Set effective team norms Practical tips for managing multi-cultural teams • Create superordinate goals and task interdependence to encourage cooperation • Tailor your management approach to each employee • Develop cultural intelligence (Rockstuhl et al., 2011) • Lead by example / must be authentic • Identify cross-cultural conflict and intervene to mediate and prevent escalation • Set effective norms: • E.g., Normalise that asking people to repeat themselves is okay • Discourage stereotyping and generalisations Productively address conflict in team meetings section 3: Implicit Leadership Theories (ILTs) & Leader Evaluation •ILTs can play an important role in shaping employee’s perceptions of their manager through a “prototype vs. actual matching ” process à ILTs Recognition •The more prototypic qualities (e.g., dynamic, strong, intelligent) employees recognize in their direct manager, the better the relationship they develop with them, and the higher their job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and well-being ( Epitropaki & Martin, 2005) •Overlap between ILT and self-concepts facilitates the development of a leader identity (De Rue & Ashford, 2010) What shapes ILTs? •ILT’s are shaped by a person’s culture, experiences, upbringing, and background •As the world of work becomes more complex and multicultural the implications for ILT’s are significant •Leaders of highly diverse teams are bound to fall short in someone’s eyes •Highly relevant to cross-cultural leadership and intercultural competence Charismatic leadership • Leaders who possess an extraordinary ability to inspire and influence others through their personal charisma, vision, and conviction • Create a sense of loyalty and commitment among their followers In cultures that value humility and modesty, a leader who displays too much charisma may be seen as arrogant or narcissistic, and may not be well received by followers Team-oriented leadership • Leaders who prioritize collaboration, cooperation, and teamwork • Place a high value on building relationships and creating a sense of community among team members Especially effective in cultures that value collectivism/interdependence, and in organisations that require coordination and cooperation among team members Participative leadership • Leaders who actively seek input and involvement from their followers in the decision-making process • Create a sense of ownership, which increases engagement and performance Con: while they prioritize input and collaboration, they must also be able to make tough decisions when necessary Humane-oriented leadership • Leaders who prioritize the well-being and development of their followers • Often effective in collectivistic cultures, such as in many Asian and Latin American countries (Cheng & Tjosvold, 2006) Can be effective in cultures that prioritize femininity, leaders who exhibit empathy and compassion are seen as effective Autonomous leadership • Leaders who are independent, individualistic, and self-reliant • Rely on their own judgment, take initiative, and work independently • Comfortable with taking risks and making decisions on their own Successful in cultures that value individualism and personal autonomy. Less effective in collectivistic cultures. Self-protective leader • Leaders who prioritize their own self interests and the interests of their in- group over those of their organization or team • Defensive and focused on protecting their own position and power • Resistant to change or innovation, more concerned with maintaining the status quo More prevalent in cultures that prioritize power distance House’s Path-Goal Theory Describes how leaders can encourage and support followers in achieving goals by making the path they should take to performance clear and easy • Leaders: • Clarify the path so subordinates know which way to go • Remove obstacles that prevent them from going there • Increase the rewards along the route •Based on Expectancy Theory of motivation House’s Path-Goal Theory • Leader must make expectations and potential rewards clear to followers • Followers will be more motivated if task completion will create a path toward a valued goal A situational model of leadership (i.e., appropriate leadership style depends on situation) Leader must adapt style to show the path to valued goals Other examples • Employees who perform simple and routine tasks will respond more positively to a supportive style rather than a directive one • Participative style works much better for nonroutine tasks than routine ones • When team cohesiveness is low, a supportive leadership style should be used; however, in a situation where performance-oriented team norms exist, a directive style or possibly an achievement-oriented style works better Leaders should apply directive style to counteract team norms that oppose the team’s formal objectives Criticisms of Path-Goal Theory • The theory is complex and difficult to interpret • Therefore, how can it be successfully implemented in practice? Empirical studies have demonstrated only partial support for the theory Goleman’s Six Leadership Styles Identify the most and least effective style for each situation 1. Improving performance of a highly motivated team member with low experience 2. Resolving and healing rifts in a team 3. Helping an a newly hired employee develop new skills 4. Dealing with experienced but unmotivated employees 5. Fostering collaboration and two-way communication 6. Solving an urgent high-stake situation 7. Making a decision that will have a big impact on your team 8. Quickly reaching high performance standards to achieve an important goal How do you expand your repertoire? •Learn to read situational cues as things evolve and seamlessly adjust your style accordingly • Self-awareness • Ask questions, listen, observe • Contingency plans: Prepare multiple plans for reaching goals rather than getting stuck on one solution Develop emotional intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BEM2035 2024 assessment brief and marking criteria.pdf\""]",125.55,6.28,119.27,,109.175.187.176,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.2 Safari/605.1.15",13/03/2024 6:02,0000-00-00 00:00:00

An explorative study to understand how digital nomads exploit the opportunities in the platform ecosystem to build a dream lifestyle. The research should investigate what kind of work is performed, how the commodification of labour takes place in the platform economy in relation to digital nomads. I have attached a copy of my first draft of the literature review with revisions by my dissertation supervisor, along with a guidelines required by my university. I should produce a qualitative research study based on content analysis of the principal digital platforms that digital nomads use/create/engage with to perform their job and therefore construct their lifestyle. The main idea that I would like to develop through this paper is that Digital Nomads are commodifying any aspect of their life through the romanticisation and disneyfication of their lifestyle that includes both private and working life. I am Business Management student and my dissertation should tackle the topic under a business point of view, discussing major market trends, business opportunities and managerial implications of the development of digital nomadism economy.

Some recommendations on your findings and preliminary conclusions part of the project: - Start by stating your research question and your aims/objectives, so that you can relate the remainder of the work to these. - Collate any data you have collected (using Excel or similar). - Look at it, summarise it (how many, when, how often, trends, any sharp decline or increase, etc.). - Think about the best way to structure your findings/results e.g., by themes. This may take several attempts of trying out different ways. - For the analysis/discussion section, relate the results to your research questions. - Are there any surprises or are the results in line with what you expected, given what the literature says? - If there are surprises, then you might question whether the literature you have used is out of date, or whether your data is limited, or whether you have genuinely found something new. - Preliminary conclusions should include: what this study found that was either supporting the literature or completely new, limitations of the study (e.g., method used), recommendations for future research, how this study has added to our knowledge or understanding of the topic being researched. Having completed all the three main parts of your project (i.e., context and literature, theories and techniques, findings and preliminary conclusions), you are in a position to produce your final project. Some recommendations on the final project: - Re-write the three main parts of your projects so that they form a cohesive and consistent piece of work when put together. For example, the same research aim(s) and objectives should run through the whole of the dissertation. Also, the theories and techniques part was based on what you were intending to do, but the actual method you employed might have been very different, so you will need to re-write it in the past tense in terms of what actually happened. Criticising your own approach (based on the literature where appropriate) is a very good way to demonstrate that you have understood why your study turned out the way it did, and how an alternative approach might have produced different results. - It is perfectly acceptable to go back to your literature review and add literature that you have since found. - You are also permissible to use material that you submitted in T1. You will not be accused of plagiarism if you use this material, but you should consider whether it is still relevant to your study. - The abstract should be a summary of your study: what is the study about? What method was used? What findings are there? What are the conclusions? - Introduction should include: what is the study about? Why is it of interest? (“recent studies have shown that…”) - Conclusions should summarise the key findings from your study, suggest future areas for research, and indicate any limitations. - Have you complied with ALL the requirements for evidence of the process undertaken? Key structure : Title Abstract Introduction Literature Review Research questions/hypotheses Methodology Data description Empirical findings conclusion Reference Appendices, Tables and Figures Results Section : The results part of the research paper is where you report the outcome of your examinations or testing following the methodology you have applied. The results section states the findings without bias. The results section needs to be arranged in a logical sequence. The results section is normally written in past tense. Results section helps view the research problem from various perspectives. A well-presented results section is actually a great way to organise the results in a way that closely linked to the research questions/hypotheses. A good results section helps the interpretation of the results in the discussion section of your paper. What to include in the Results section : An introductory context for understanding the results A summary of your key results arranged in a logical sequence A systematic description of your results, highlighting observations that are most relevant to the topic under investigation. Effective inclusion of non-textual elements  more on the next slide Summarise your findings and point the reader to the relevant data in the text, figures and/or tables. Non-textual elements : Bring added clarity to a study Useful tools for summarising information Highlight important pieces of information without breaking up the narrative flow of your paper Non-textual elements are visually engaging.  However!!! : Do not overuse non-textual elements! Please refer to your tables and figures in your main text. Pay attention to detail The discussion section : The general purpose of the discussion section is to interpret your findings considering what was already known about the research problem being investigated explain any new understanding or fresh insights about the problem based on your findings. connect to research questions or hypotheses explain how your study has moved forward or broadened the reader\'s understanding of the research problem. The Discussion Section is often regarded as the most important part of a research paper. Why? Why is the discussion section important? It is directly linked to the examination of the Research questions/hypotheses. It is the right place for analytical and critical interpretation of your results. This is the section where you present the importance of your study. What to include in a discussion section? Explain the results in detail (Research questions/hypotheses) Analyse any unexpected findings. References to previous research. Highlight the importance of your research Check if your Discussion Section achieves the following objectives: Have you discussed in full the major findings? Have you linked your findings to you research questions/hypotheses? Have you explained why your findings are important?  this links to any gaps in existing study Have you related your findings to relevant previous studies? Have you considered alternative explanations for any unexpected findings? Some final notes: make your points clearly and concise follow a logical stream of thought use subheadings if needed to help organise your presentation Keep the following in your mind when writing: For each statistical test, clearly indicate what that particular statistical result says about the hypothesis or question. Was your hypothesis supported by the result? Tables and figures help the reader visualise the important results, but not carry the bulk of the work in the presentation of your findings. Rewrite until you are sure you tested your hypotheses and the reader can easily determine what the results indicate in terms of your hypotheses or questions. Number figures and tables consecutively in the same sequence they are first mentioned in the text. Provide a heading for each figure and table. Write with accuracy and clarity!!! Conclusion : How to write a Conclusion When writing a conclusion, you should try to answer a few questions, as succinctly as possible (You will have already answered some of these in your discussion). Check that your work answers the following questions: What was the research question/hypothesis of the paper? What you have done in this paper (your research design) What were the main findings of the research? Did the research project answered or provided evidence for the research question/hypothesis? Did the research project meet its aims (check back to introduction for stated aims)? Limitations and/or possible future development related to your research (if you have not discussed it anywhere else in your project. The answers to the above questions need to be very concisely summarised in the Conclusion.",,,,,No,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Quants Proposal Finance Research.docx\""]",167.4,8.37,159.03,,212.132.214.158,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",17/03/2024 1:50,0000-00-00 00:00:00

The proposed idea should be closely related to one of the topics covered in the module (see module outline). The proposal should focus on either intergroup relations, intragroup relations or both. In general, it should address questions relevant to groups that have a purpose or a common goal; i.e., groups situated in organisational, political or other purposeful contexts (e.g., workgroups, sports teams/fan clubs, political groups etc). Your proposal will need to discuss the implications of your study for both theory and practice in social and organisational psychology. • For example, your proposal can identify a gap in the literature and describe a study to address that gap. Your proposed study can also be a conceptual replication of a previous study from the literature. However, in that case, it must become clear how your proposed study critically extends that previous work. In addition, try not to involve more than 3-4 key variables, for example, two independent variables (or predictors) and one or two main dependent variables (or outcome measures), but also consider whether you need to measure or control for other variables. Specific instructions • Format: All text and references must be formatted to the most recent APA style guidelines for writing in Psychology (at least APA7). When formatting to APA style you should include a running head, up to 5 keywords, and please pay attention to heading style and labels. You will also be penalised for language faults such as poor grammar, spelling and sentence structure. Therefore, please proofread your work carefully. • Word limits: The research proposal can have a maximum of 4,000 words. Within this limit, it should include the following sections. Title page, Abstract (separate page, no more than 200 words), Introduction and Theory, Methods, Planned Analyses, and Discussion. These sections must not exceed a total of 2,500 words. A good general rule is to devote 1/3 of your space to Introduction/Theory, 1/3 to Methods, and 1/3 to Analyses/Discussion. • Starting on a new page, References, technical information and/or appendices may be up to a further 1500 words. As a guide you should include between 10 and 20 references for a research proposal. • A good Abstract should summarize the central question and main points from each of the sections. • The Introduction and Theory section should explain the central research question or problem, and conclude end with some explicitly articulated research hypotheses. • The Methods section should have subsections such as: Design, Participants, Procedure and Materials. Remember also to consider ethical and participant consent issues. • The Analysis section should explain and justify the choice of analytic techniques and/or statistical tests you would plan to use to assess the evidence you collect. • In the Discussion section, in addition to considering the potewntial value of the research (including the theoretical and practical implications) it is important that you can reflect on some potential limitations of your proposed study. • Include the word count of the main text and also the total word count (main text plus references/appendices) on your title page. As essays are exercises in concise technical writing, those that are longer than the word limit (or unwarrantably short) will be penalised.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,195.3,9.76,185.53,,129.12.171.18,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",17/03/2024 5:26,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Coursework 2 - Impact of Changing Global World on Businesses This assignment is an individual assignment divided in Part A and B. Part A. You have been hired to provide consultancy services to a growing for-profit small and medium enterprise based in UK that desires to internationalise to a country where it is not currently operating in. Your chosen company must be a real company with headquarters in the UK. You should prepare a report which addresses the following: 1. Provide background information on your chosen company (Business model & Strategy, Revenue & Profit, Number of Employees, etc) 2. What are the formal and informal institutional considerations/challenges of that chosen country that the UK SME should be aware of? 3: Using appropriate theories/frameworks, analyse the industry of the SME in the chosen country for internationalisation. 4: By referring to appropriate theories/concepts/frameworks, provide evidence of how the SME should internationalise to that chosen country. 5: Based on your analysis above and referencing at least a sustainability theory, make recommendations on how the SME should overcome the challenges identified in 2 above This Resit assignment requires you to rework on your original submission taking into consideration the feedback you have received online as well as one to one from your module leader or seminar tutor. In addition to improving your previous submission, you are also required to write a 300-word reflective account in which you discuss how you have considered the feedback on your first submission to amend your work, and how it now meets the Learning Outcomes and Criteria for the Assessment. I do not need to do the part B from this assignment because I did not participate to that project.

Instructions for Task 2 Full Project : You are required to submit your final research project (3000 words). Some recommendations on your findings and preliminary conclusions part of the project: - Start by stating your research question and your aims/objectives, so that you can relate the remainder of the work to these. - Collate any data you have collected (using Excel or similar). - Look at it, summarise it (how many, when, how often, trends, any sharp decline or increase, etc.). - Think about the best way to structure your findings/results e.g., by themes. This may take several attempts of trying out different ways. - For the analysis/discussion section, relate the results to your research questions. - Are there any surprises or are the results in line with what you expected, given what the literature says? - If there are surprises, then you might question whether the literature you have used is out of date, or whether your data is limited, or whether you have genuinely found something new. - Preliminary conclusions should include: what this study found that was either supporting the literature or completely new, limitations of the study (e.g., method used), recommendations for future research, how this study has added to our knowledge or understanding of the topic being researched. Having completed all the three main parts of your project (i.e., context and literature, theories and techniques, findings and preliminary conclusions), you are in a position to produce your final project. Some recommendations on the final project: - Re-write the three main parts of your projects so that they form a cohesive and consistent piece of work when put together. For example, the same research aim(s) and objectives should run through the whole of the dissertation. Also, the theories and techniques part was based on what you were intending to do, but the actual method you employed might have been very different, so you will need to re-write it in the past tense in terms of what actually happened. Criticising your own approach (based on the literature where appropriate) is a very good way to demonstrate that you have understood why your study turned out the way it did, and how an alternative approach might have produced different results. - It is perfectly acceptable to go back to your literature review and add literature that you have since found. - You are also permissible to use material that you submitted in T1. You will not be accused of plagiarism if you use this material, but you should consider whether it is still relevant to your study. - The abstract should be a summary of your study: what is the study about? What method was used? What findings are there? What are the conclusions? - Introduction should include: what is the study about? Why is it of interest? (“recent studies have shown that…”) - Conclusions should summarise the key findings from your study, suggest future areas for research, and indicate any limitations. - Have you complied with ALL the requirements for evidence of the process undertaken? Key structure : Title Abstract Introduction Literature Review Research questions/hypotheses Methodology Data description Empirical findings conclusion Reference Appendices, Tables and Figures Results Section : The results part of the research paper is where you report the outcome of your examinations or testing following the methodology you have applied. The results section states the findings without bias. The results section needs to be arranged in a logical sequence. The results section is normally written in past tense. Results section helps view the research problem from various perspectives. A well-presented results section is actually a great way to organise the results in a way that closely linked to the research questions/hypotheses. A good results section helps the interpretation of the results in the discussion section of your paper. What to include in the Results section : An introductory context for understanding the results A summary of your key results arranged in a logical sequence A systematic description of your results, highlighting observations that are most relevant to the topic under investigation. Effective inclusion of non-textual elements  more on the next slide Summarise your findings and point the reader to the relevant data in the text, figures and/or tables. Non-textual elements : Bring added clarity to a study Useful tools for summarising information Highlight important pieces of information without breaking up the narrative flow of your paper Non-textual elements are visually engaging. However!!! : Do not overuse non-textual elements! Please refer to your tables and figures in your main text. Pay attention to detail The discussion section : The general purpose of the discussion section is to interpret your findings considering what was already known about the research problem being investigated explain any new understanding or fresh insights about the problem based on your findings. connect to research questions or hypotheses explain how your study has moved forward or broadened the reader\'s understanding of the research problem. The Discussion Section is often regarded as the most important part of a research paper. Why? Why is the discussion section important? It is directly linked to the examination of the Research questions/hypotheses. It is the right place for analytical and critical interpretation of your results. This is the section where you present the importance of your study. What to include in a discussion section? Explain the results in detail (Research questions/hypotheses) Analyse any unexpected findings. References to previous research. Highlight the importance of your research Check if your Discussion Section achieves the following objectives: Have you discussed in full the major findings? Have you linked your findings to you research questions/hypotheses? Have you explained why your findings are important?  this links to any gaps in existing study Have you related your findings to relevant previous studies? Have you considered alternative explanations for any unexpected findings? Some final notes: make your points clearly and concise follow a logical stream of thought use subheadings if needed to help organise your presentation Keep the following in your mind when writing: For each statistical test, clearly indicate what that particular statistical result says about the hypothesis or question. Was your hypothesis supported by the result? Tables and figures help the reader visualise the important results, but not carry the bulk of the work in the presentation of your findings. Rewrite until you are sure you tested your hypotheses and the reader can easily determine what the results indicate in terms of your hypotheses or questions. Number figures and tables consecutively in the same sequence they are first mentioned in the text. Provide a heading for each figure and table. Write with accuracy and clarity!!! Conclusion : How to write a Conclusion When writing a conclusion, you should try to answer a few questions, as succinctly as possible (You will have already answered some of these in your discussion). Check that your work answers the following questions: What was the research question/hypothesis of the paper? What you have done in this paper (your research design) What were the main findings of the research? Did the research project answered or provided evidence for the research question/hypothesis? Did the research project meet its aims (check back to introduction for stated aims)? Limitations and/or possible future development related to your research (if you have not discussed it anywhere else in your project. The answers to the above questions need to be very concisely summarised in the Conclusion.

The module will encourage you to reflect upon the ways in which they themselves approach, represent and ‘remember’ the War in the act of historical research and literary criticism.",,,,,No,,,,,,,"[\""https://www.theacademicpapers.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Marking Criteria (1).png\""]",399.2,19.96,379.24,,81.146.61.155,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/122.0.0.0",19/03/2024 9:24,0000-00-00 00:00:00

We are expected to submit a research paper of minimum 2000 words and having between 25 and 30 references coming from medical and sports research articles websites such us Pubmed and other professional and reliable resources but also books. I have chosen as my research topic : “ how to repair the nervous system via the vagus nerve”, This should be more less the title that I would like to have for it but I am happy to consider any better option and more suitable suggestion from a professional and skilful writer of course. My tutor at the academy was obviously encouraging me to find some correlation between the subject of my paper and the field of sports and massage. And this is where I am mostly struggling at the moment and also time wise as I am trying to study and work at the same time.

The assignment guidance described below summarises the main features of your assignment; you will receive further guidance in class when you are also given the opportunity to conceptualise, plan and draft your assignment as required at this level. Assignment Brief, 100% of mark Word count: 1750 words (+/- 10%) Discuss the similarities and differences between your coursework and dissertation writing. a. Use evidence from past coursework and dissertation writing in progress. b. Refer to elements of academic writing as text, such as style, organisation and argument, and to issues related to the planning and process of writing the coursework and the dissertation. c. Consider the benefits and challenges of researching/writing a dissertation project and how these compare to researching/writing coursework. Note: Your assignment can be structured as an essay or as a report. Use academic writing sources (books, textbooks, articles, verified online material) effectively to support your analysis. Cite and reference sources in keeping with the APA style. You do not need to reference evidence from your coursework or your dissertation (e.g., examples from writing, assignment briefs, dissertation proposal, feedback from tutor or supervisor) because such evidence constitutes your “data”. If you consider that a larger body of evidence needs to be included, you may produce an Appendix. The Appendix will not be part of your word count. APA7 style should be used. For the assignment you are asked to compare the writing style or writing process of TWO of your undergraduate assignments to your dissertation writing. It is a reflective task so you are expected to draw on examples from your own writing; however, you should also use a small quantity of writing theory to support your findings.

You should take these and outline a modern ethical assessment of the same psychological construct considered in the original study/experiment you considered in assignment 1. It is important that you do not attempt to design a study/experiment, but that you give most of your consideration into an ethical assessment so that it would comply with current BPS guidelines. To be a little clearer. You need to say what was unethical about the study you are looking at. Then you need to address those observations and say how they could be changed if the study were to run again, in an ethical manner that complies to the BPS Code of Ethics.

There are as many different options here as there are imaginations! What we are really interested in is that you can demonstrate the application of the current ethical guidelines to human research.

For example, one of the criticisms of Milgram\'s study was that it had a sampling bias. This might be rectified by having a more cross-sectional sample. What would you have the participants do? How would this measure the same psychological construct without violating current ethical principles and/or standards. An example hereof might be that in Milgram\'s experiments, participants were visibly uncomfortable with the situation and what was asked of them. This is a risk to their mental health and wellbeing that should be avoided. How would your measurements/assessments link to the psychological construct being assessed? For example, in Milgram\'s experiments, the researcher was in the room urging the participant to \'keep going\'. Therefore, it could be argued that the research was measuring coercion rather than obedience, thus not measuring the construct of interest. A more ethical approach would need to ensure that the psychological construct of interest is being measured. Guidelines Your submission should be 1500 words in length (+/- 10%).

I am aiming for a first class and have currently been getting between 75 - 90% on all other assignments, but really struggling with my dissertation! My supervisor has briefly looked at my current literature review and has said its probably at around 60% but they are understaffed and unable to give thorough feedback. I have also attached the mark scheme, my research proposal poster (I got 79% for this), and the background of my introduction that I have put before my literature review to show some context.

See below the excerpt from my dissertation handbook regarding the analysis of findings chapter: 4.0 Analysis of Findings When constructing a qualitative based analysis chapter you need to ensure that the section is structured appropriately. The chapter should start with restating your research question and the purpose of the research. Focus is then needed on how you wish to present your qualitative data/findings so that they are responsive to the research question being addressed. This can be done in a number of ways for example, Research Questions Order, Themes or Chronological Events. This could also include visual formats such as word clouds, network diagrams, thematic maps, charts and graphs where appropriate. Evidence within this section should be based upon a thematic transcript of data, providing full and thorough evidence of qualitative data collection. All transcripts should be provided within the appendices and referred to appropriately as evidence throughout the chapter. Consideration here is needed to ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of participants (GDPR, 2018).

Chapter 2 – Literature review Background and critical reflection of the contemporary corpus of literature 30% of marks; remember 30% of 6000 word allowance = 1800 words In this section you are required to review research articles on your topic. Therefore, you need to search for research articles focused on your topic and select a suitable amount to support your discussion. The literature review should have a logical flow in which the key issues are clearly articulated, therefore in this section you should aim to: • demonstrate how you have formulated a question that you can answer from the literature • provide a clear description of the search strategy, you could include which databases you used, the search terms you have inputted (structured around PICO/PEO/SPIDER) whether you used Boolean searching, and how you decided to include or exclude articles • demonstrate the ability to develop logical arguments using the literature presented, this will likely be supported through the use of two or three themes which have come from the research literature • provide clear evidence of the ability to critically evaluate the research literature • demonstrate the ability to critically appraise the methodology of the research evidence presented, for this consider how the research was completed and use CASP tools to support your assessment of their quality • summarise the justification for your choice of project and your project approach arising from literature. This is your link to section three. Chapter 3 – Research proposal Plan of research design methodology, key strategies used to assess the effectiveness of tools and techniques used, ethical considerations 30% of marks; remember 30% of 6000 word allowance = 1800 words Within the research design methodology aim to: • provide a copy of your research project plan using the following framework o Method  This should identify the research method being used to underpin the study and explain why this is an appropriate method for answering your research question. o Design  How will the research proceed? o Participants  Participant selection should include a discussion around sampling and recruitment. o Ethics  How will you ensure the safety of participants? Think about ethical approval processes, consent, safety, debrief etc o Materials and equipment  What do you need to complete the research study? o Procedure  This section should identify the plan of how the research will be conducted. o Data collection  How will you collect data? This may be questionnaires, focus groups etc. o Data analysis  How will the collected data be analysed? NB remember to remain critical and avoid merely describing your proposed plan for implementation.

Please see below the excerpt from my dissertation handbook regarding the literature review chapter: 2.0 Review of Literature Please note that a review of literature is required for Primary and Secondary Research. This should contain a review and critique of the relevant literature referring to key papers and recent research in your chosen area. Put your own work into the context of others, and state the current knowledge of the area of investigation. Your literature review should be critical rather than descriptive and should identify weaknesses in methodologies and gaps in current knowledge, making suggestions for further research. Please note that a review of literature is not the same as an annotated bibliography. It is advised that you organise this thematically and ideally have no more than 5 sub-sections. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Purpose of a Literature Review - Demonstrate your knowledge of the field Randolph (2007; pg. 2) suggests this means \""vocabulary, theories, key variables and phenomena, and its methods and history\"" it also provides information about \""the influential researchers and research groups in the field\"" The literature review is an opportunity to present the gap in the literature or research field, it enables a researcher to highlight and address methodological insights /themes in the field that may pose new insights for inquiry. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The 5 C\'s of Literature Reviews Cite Compare Contrast Critique Connect _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ How to Approach the Literature Review: Thematic vs Linear A linear approach to a literature seeks to review one study / previous piece of research at a time, choosing to critically analysis the piece of research, its strengths and weaknesses and wider support or critique. Within an undergraduate literature review it would be expected that between 8-10 pieces of research are discussed and reviewed with wider research bought in to provide the critical analysis. An alternative approach however is a Thematic Approach A thematic approach seeks to group research and its findings into themes, ideas or concepts, here the research covered may be wider and highlight linkage between previous research outcomes and conclusions. This is the most common form / approach of Literature Reviews and provides a greater opportunity for deeper critical analysis and demonstration of the wider knowledge of the subject/research area. When picking the research out to include within your literature review you should always be considering the strength of the research in relation to your research area and how relevant the piece of research is for engaging the reader in the research area and moving the topic forward towards your research idea. Therefore ask yourself as you research for the literature review is \""should this evidence play a part in my literature review, and if so how and where?\"" By identifying the links between research and whether the research is supportive or in contrast to an argument being presented is key. Literature reviews should be made up entirely of secondary literature that is academic and relevant to the research area (i.e. others findings) they should not contain new information or knowledge (i.e. your research outcomes). _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Writing your Literature Review When writing your literature review think about the process of uncovering a story, from general concepts, theories and ideas to a specific outcome (i.e. the need for your research to be conducted) During the beginning of the literature review it is imperative that you introduce and define the main concepts, terms and theories as this will provide a clear foundation for the reader (and meet the scientific principles of research; precision and parsimony) The further through your literature the more specific research needs to be linked with your topic. Often it is easier to research Specific outwards to more general and then write inwards (general to specific) Please see the below link for additional guidance: https://www.kent.ac.uk/guides/literature-reviews/literature-reviews",,,,,No,,,,,,,,139.5,6.97,132.53,,151.227.83.204,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/122.0.0.0",26/03/2024 3:33,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Health strategies report will be a description of the health inequalities of a chosen population (Hounslow Borough of London), an analysis of a joint strategic needs assessment (JSNA) and the joint health and wellbeing strategy (JHWS). 3. This report is intended to enhance your understanding of JSNA and JHWS. 4. you will identify the joint health and well-being strategy (JHWBS) linked to the JSNA. 5. The choice of JSNA and associated JHWBS will be decided by you. 6. For the chosen community identify the most current JSNA and JHWBS: An example of how to do this using Islington Council is as follows: (a) Refer to Islington Council Website (b) Use the search engine to find the joint strategic needs assessment. (c) You can then access the current JSNA (d) You can then access the current JHWBS linked to this JSNA 8. The written report should be 1200 words (+/- 10%) (including tables, figures and appendices), fully referenced, word processed, Arial font, size 11, and 1.5 line spaced. You should use Harvard referencing style. There will be a reduction in marks for students who exceed the word count by 10% and/or excessive use of tables. There is no fixed or rigid format for your report, but you must work within the word limit of 1200 words. A suggested structure could be along the following lines: (700 words): Analysis of the JSNA and the JHWBS Discuss and analyse the JSNA & JHWBS • Consider the following: • Does the JSNA identify key priority outcomes related to nutrition, considering community/patient experiences, local needs and preferences, risk assessments, national priorities and other guidance, such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines? • Outline and describe the strategies or policies which are being delivered. • What is the rationale for the strategies/policies? • Which stakeholders are involved? • Are the policies wide ranging, including food retailers/outlets, schools, the built environment, the media, healthcare etc. • Who are the target population? For example, is it only children and young people or all the community? • Does the policy have set targets (e.g., to see a fall in obesity prevalence by the year 20XX), or an increase in the intake of fruits and vegetables? • Comment on whether an evaluation of progress has been considered. • Evaluate the content of the policy and perhaps compare its strengths and weaknesses with the literature or the Healthy Weight Healthy Lives document. • If possible, assess any impact or effectiveness of the policy and if there is evidence of outcomes from the policy e.g., a fall in obesity prevalence, a reduction in mean BMI, an increase in the consumption of fruit and vegetables. • Discuss whether the JHWBS meets the population health needs directly related to nutrition. • Identify and write about any potential gaps in the strategy. • Identify any further evidence from the literature that supports the selected strategy. Recommendations and final comments (500 words) • Where possible, suggest how any gaps in strategy/policy activities can be filled, e.g., a lack of breastfeeding initiatives, workplace health promotion etc). • If they plan to undertake any evaluation and how this is to be conducted, it would be worth mentioning. • Consider any new health strategies to improve the health status of your population using the evidence base. Refer to published examples from the literature. It is appropriate to use international publications where relevant. • Identify any potential barriers to the development of a robust and effective JSNA and to the implementation of the JHWBS. Refer to published material. • Finally, include a conclusion, around 1-2 sentences. You will need a list of key references to support your analysis /evaluation. These can be in the form of a URL or link to a specific website and any other sources of information you have used to produce this report.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,89.75,4.49,85.26,,2.29.186.243,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",26/03/2024 8:37,0000-00-00 00:00:00

My Dissertation Question is: Compare and contrast the various routes to stereopsis with a view to concluding what stereopsis is for This is a project about stereopsis in general—not just the route from binocular disparity but also from monocular cues (both pictorial and motion) and not forgetting da Vinci stereopsis. Are estimates of distance and 3D relief comparable or different across stereoscopic and non-stereoscopic experiences of the world? Is stereopsis simply on/off (i.e. present/absent) or might it be graded (strong -> weak -> absent)? And the question arises, how do you assess true stereopsis (by which I mean \'solid vision\') experimentally? Are the techniques needed as reliable as those we use to assess performance (2AFC)? And why can performance measures not tell us about the quality of solid vision? Also, this Q is not just about digging into the literature. Your own thinking should come into play and lead you to relevant literature to test your ideas. E.g. Try making observations of different scenes with one and two eyes while moving (e.g. rocking from side to side) and standing/sitting still. Are there some stimuli for which two eyes do bring a benefit? Try finding some \'fractal\' stimuli like a Christmas Tree. Why is binocularity so valuable there? i.e. why do the pictorial cues not do such a great job? What needs to be included is about 500-1000 words that answers the question: how can we compare stereopsis with one and two eyes? (The Paper from Vishwanath and Hibbard can be helpful here as well as some useful slides I\'ve added). I\'ve also attached a couple of items to help get you going in general.

A comprehensive analysis of role effectiveness and considerable changes.",Dissertation,6000,24,Harvard,60,3,"Hello, I would like help with the Introduction, methodology, and conclusion/recommendation parts of the dissertation. With INTRODUCTION I would like to include : What policing was before 2002 when PSCO has been introduced (no staff to gather intelligence, lack of community engagement, lack of visibility, not full understanding of community needs and not always adequate response to it). Next part would be to recognision of the demand and Police Reform Act 2002 that brought PCSO to police family. Recuorces : Section 38 A Police reform Act 2002, Policing and Crime Bill 2016, Policing and Crime Act 2017 Also to mention powers od PSCO then and now, last time PSCO powers in Gwent were signed and agreed in 2017, powers in Gwent - 27 and now we had assigned additional 7? Also to mention that society is changing and that may infuecle saftey of PSCO but also is it possible to respond to call effectively with not enough relevant powers. Powers can bee looked at Gwent police 2021 when after extensive consultations they agreed to expand them. Please, to include that not each froce has the same powers. They are depending on discretion of Chief constable and Chief officers (500 - 1000 words) unless you think differently METHODOLOGY - probably what is research - types etc and how they differ and why interview was the one been chosen by resesrcher (i decided as i know all my participants and the number of them is not that big, it was the best way to get concrid answers and to discuss what changes they noticed during service - within communities: society and crime changes etc) Why this primary research, qualiative research over quantitative (mabye a definition) realibility and validity of the research? not sure what else (2500 words) Conclusion and recomendations: the research showed that PSCO with long service are content with the job but also suggested that additional powers and training are needed. Those with short service seem to be more eager and voicing their opinions more openly and are more likely to address them. Perhaps to discuss that the rotation is massive within PSCO - they don\'t seem to stay long and looking for other vacancies - internally and externally. (not sure how many words 1500?) Please contact me at any time to discuss any additional questions. My writing style is not poor, but it is not the highest level.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,478.8,47.88,430.92,,90.202.122.35,"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/122.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",30/03/2024 1:48,0000-00-00 00:00:00

In the document called interstitial triplication 15q11 I have written an explanation of what needs to go here but please also look at the good reference example to understand what is expected in this section. The main focus of this piece of work is to evidence critical appraisal of work that exists around the interstitial triplication 15q11.2-13.2 and duplication (in this region) that is available, to then synthesise points from this. Critical appraisal should look at sample size-generalisabilty, the technology used in the existing literature versus technology now... question the validity, accuracy and generalisability... also appraising these things where appropriate to evidence a balanced approach. There needs to be between 10-15 pieces of scientific evidence which is included in this section- this can look at both the triplication and duplication in this region to discuss and critically appraise this here. The markers are very harsh, but are more concerned with critical appraisal and synthesis being clearly demonstrated rather than the words being \'fancy\'/ \'eloquently written\'.

Literature overview passage (not more than 500 words) and identification of a possible gap and hence future direction for potential research. You are free to choose any reference style as long as you are consistent in applying it. Please, include a separate passage in the final document that you have contributed to the Wikipedia page, including the link/potential link (for the bonus 0,5 point) and your contribution. For a very indicative example for your ‘final product’ on point 3, see, for instance, this piece (from my own publication, link): The enforcement of European Union (EU) law is a crucial element in the implementation of policies (Falkner et al. 2005; Knill and Tosun 2012). How does the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), for instance, know whether air companies fly airplanes which comply with EU airworthiness and environmental requirements if they are not being checked? Enforcement, i.e., monitoring compliance, investigating an alleged violation and the sanctioning of a violation, can rectify non-compliance and promote the attainment of policy goals. (Multilevel implementation) research on the enforcement of EU law has been scarce and has focused largely on domestic compliance with EU law, mostly at the transposition stage (but see Thomann 2015), the enforcement of EU law by national authorities, especially in the field of environmental law (Faure 2004;Martens 2006; Tosun 2012; Treib 2014; Versluis 2003; Versluis and Tarr 2013; Vervaele 1999a; Wenneras 2007) and the area of financial fraud (Pujas 2003; Quirke 2010; Vervaele and Luchtman 2015; Vervaele 2013), and the traditional area of EU direct enforcement in competition law (Articles 101 and 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [TFEU]; Cseres 2016; Jones and Sufrin 2014; Monti 2007). The traditional division between regulatory and enforcement stages of the policy cycle belonging to the EU and national levels respectively can explain the existing focus. This division has, however, changed drastically in recent years. In approximately the last 15 years, the number of EU enforcement authorities (EEAs) has grown from one to seven. EEAs enforce EU law directly vis-à-vis private actors like banks and air companies. Some EEAs trace their roots back to EU enforcement (not necessarily regulatory) networks, the number of which has been growing considerably and today includes at least 20 entities. Also, enforcement standards deriving from EU hard, soft and case law have been increasingly regulating domestic enforcement. The EU thus seems to have employed three enforcement strategies in promoting the implementation of its policies. Little is known, however, on whether and upon what circumstances these strategies can be and have been effective. In this light, the trend of ‘enforcement moving to “Brussels”’ adds a so far neglected perspective in EU (multilevel implementation) research, namely the question of what role is there for the EU to play in the traditionally national enforcement of EU law.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,219.45,10.97,208.48,,46.244.6.113,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",03/04/2024 8:58,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Literature overview passage (not more than 500 words) and identification of a possible gap and hence future direction for potential research. You are free to choose any reference style as long as you are consistent in applying it. Please, include a separate passage in the final document that you have contributed to the Wikipedia page, including the link/potential link (for the bonus 0,5 point) and your contribution. For a very indicative example for your ‘final product’ on point 3, see, for instance, this piece (from my own publication, link): The enforcement of European Union (EU) law is a crucial element in the implementation of policies (Falkner et al. 2005; Knill and Tosun 2012). How does the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), for instance, know whether air companies fly airplanes which comply with EU airworthiness and environmental requirements if they are not being checked? Enforcement, i.e., monitoring compliance, investigating an alleged violation and the sanctioning of a violation, can rectify non-compliance and promote the attainment of policy goals. (Multilevel implementation) research on the enforcement of EU law has been scarce and has focused largely on domestic compliance with EU law, mostly at the transposition stage (but see Thomann 2015), the enforcement of EU law by national authorities, especially in the field of environmental law (Faure 2004;Martens 2006; Tosun 2012; Treib 2014; Versluis 2003; Versluis and Tarr 2013; Vervaele 1999a; Wenneras 2007) and the area of financial fraud (Pujas 2003; Quirke 2010; Vervaele and Luchtman 2015; Vervaele 2013), and the traditional area of EU direct enforcement in competition law (Articles 101 and 102 Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union [TFEU]; Cseres 2016; Jones and Sufrin 2014; Monti 2007). The traditional division between regulatory and enforcement stages of the policy cycle belonging to the EU and national levels respectively can explain the existing focus. This division has, however, changed drastically in recent years. In approximately the last 15 years, the number of EU enforcement authorities (EEAs) has grown from one to seven. EEAs enforce EU law directly vis-à-vis private actors like banks and air companies. Some EEAs trace their roots back to EU enforcement (not necessarily regulatory) networks, the number of which has been growing considerably and today includes at least 20 entities. Also, enforcement standards deriving from EU hard, soft and case law have been increasingly regulating domestic enforcement. The EU thus seems to have employed three enforcement strategies in promoting the implementation of its policies. Little is known, however, on whether and upon what circumstances these strategies can be and have been effective. In this light, the trend of ‘enforcement moving to “Brussels”’ adds a so far neglected perspective in EU (multilevel implementation) research, namely the question of what role is there for the EU to play in the traditionally national enforcement of EU law.",,,,,No,,,,,,,,239.4,11.97,227.43,,46.244.6.113,"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/123.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",03/04/2024 8:59,0000-00-00 00:00:00

The UAE is geographically located in a highly arid region that makes water security a huge concern, briefly the UAE don’t have another option but to desalinate seawater to be able to meet the high demands of our exponentially increasing population. In this study, our focus will be mainly on how to desalinate seawater sustainably. 1. This study aims to basically evaluate and assess the UAE Desalination Facilities implementation to sustainability standards and best practices (using one desalination facility in Abu Dhabi as a baseline). At the same time this research proposal also assesses the Brine Discharge Impacts on the Arabian Gulf Seawater Quality via Environment Impact Assessment and by conducting a series of sustainability studies to ensure compliance of best industrial practices. 2. This study also intends to present tangible strategic sustainable solutions and recommendations and put forward a clear-detailed roadmap of how we could desalinate seawater without damaging the marine environment by treating the brine reject along with its accompanied harmful waste chemical effluents instead of discharging it back to the seawater. Due to the increasing brine discharge activities alternative solutions via Integrated Brine Waste Treatment Technologies must be thoroughly considered in all desalination plants initial designs and engineering modification. This process will not only save our marine life and ecosystems from further degradation but also benefit the UAE economy, as it will create a win-win solution where the treated waste could be commercialized and used for other applications and utilized in the market. By this approach we are also creating a circular economic market, which in a nutshell will harmonize the relationship between humans and our natural environment. 3. Desalination processes and operations are proven to be highly energy-intensive, therefore a sustainability study must be conducted to measure the GHGs, and CO2 emissions released from these facilities to capture, treat, & utilize these emissions by considering a closed-loop operational design to make maximum use of those GHGs. Desalination plants are run by hydrocarbon fuel therefore in this study we intend to find feasible solutions to replace traditional source of power supply with clean sources of energy and figure out ways to integrate renewable energy into the plants (For example connecting those facilities with nuclear power source grid if not already established) and considering AI as a key game changer to play its critically vital role in optimizing the process of operations by advancing the monitoring of the control systems. Turning our risks and threats into sustainable solutions for our current and future generations. 4. Review and discuss the role of policies, regulations, and legal framework to reinforce the effective compliance and implementation of sustainability practices in all the desalination facilities across the region. Lastly, recommend a regional GCC minstrel level large scale environmental recovery plan to the Arabian Gulf Seawater with a timeline that must be governed by a legal treaty framework under the supervision of the United Nations.

C Recognise the value of research and analysis and to be able to evaluate such evidence to inform practice and draw reasoned conclusions. D Be alert to the strengths and various limitations of existing research and demonstrate their knowledge of ethical and moral principles when conducting secondary research. Assessment Brief Independent study: The student will choose a topic of particular interest and relevance to their practice or placement and consider evidence based research and best practice informing this area of study. The assignment will enable your skills in researching topics, critically analysing research and applying to social work practice. This will involve developing the following: Promoting research-mindedness and a capacity for evidence informed practice Identification, evaluation and use of information resources Assessing evidence and making ‘informed judgments’ on its quality Making sense of and applying different types of evidence Encouraging research literacy Considering a small number of research methods (qualitative and/or quantitative) Evaluating their use and suitability, and the ‘reliability and validity’ of findings Developing research skills Problem identification and conceptualisation Clarifying purposes of inquiry Generating ‘evidence-informed’ and justifiable conclusions Acquiring capacity to apply lessons learnt This is to be written in an essay style and will comprise of 3000 words. It is worth 20 credits and at this level a significant degree of analysis and critique is required. The aim is for you to research an area of particular interest related to your practice (current or past) or an organisational issue related to the Social Care setting in which you have practised. It is a detailed review of existing research literature or findings. You will consider a minimum of three pieces of research (maximum five) which will be analysed to consider how they inform and impact on the area of practice/organisational structure you are considering. The independent research study provides you with the opportunity to learn about one area that you find particularly interesting and important, to describe and define it, and carry out some in-depth, thoughtful and thorough research. You should be able to identify the main intellectual debates around your subject and provide a critical overview. Suggested Structure Introduction: Introduction/background to the topic and reasons why this topic has been chosen (rationale). • Set the context and link to practice • Provide a clear statement of the over-arching research area/question. • Outline your area of practice/organisational issue and identify what you plan to cover in this assignment including the main research articles. Section on evidence based practice and research: Why is evidence-based practice important for Social Work as a profession and how does it inform practice and outcomes for service users and carers (general principles at this stage). Section outlining the particular research and area of practice /organisational structure you are considering. (Min 3 pieces of research, max 5) What are the key trends in the research and how is it linked to your topic? Analysis of, evaluation and discussion of the chosen research papers. How the area of practice/organisational structure might be further developed - what further research is required? Conclusion/recommendations/implications This should provide a final overview of the ‘Independent Research Study’ in terms of its main points and areas of learning. Some recommendations with regard to a ways forward might be given. Submission Details Submission Format: Submit your assignment as a single file in EITHER PDF or MSWord format.

I would like to ask you for help with my research project as I am really struggling with time as since I started working two jobs last year, being a single parent and having English as my second language I started to falling behind and struggling to cope with my studies. On top of this research project, I have another end of year assignmet to writhe from another module, which I had to postopone from last year, as again, I could not cope with mounting amount of workload I had. For my research project the topic I chosed is female activists Angela davis, Malala Yousafzai, Narges Mohammadi, Rosa Parks, Tarana Burke and Greta Thunberg. My research question is what kinds of interpretative repertoires are constructed in modern public media about female activists? Looking at the characteristics of language used in modern newspapers writing about Angela Davis, Malala Yousafzai, Tana Burke, Narges Mohammadi, Rosa Parks, and Greta Thunberg I would like my paper to investigate this issue. We are required to use Nexis database for this qualitative project. There are some parts of this research project that I already had to submit for tutor marked assignemt. I had to write a part of the literature review, and project proposal and ethical aproval.

I would like to ask you for help with my research project as I am really struggling with time as since I started working two jobs last year, being a single parent and having English as my second language I started to falling behind and struggling to cope with my studies. On top of this research project, I have another end of year assignmet to writhe from another module, which I had to postopone from last year, as again, I could not cope with mounting amount of workload I had. For my research project the topic I chosed is female activists Angela davis, Malala Yousafzai, Narges Mohammadi, Rosa Parks, Tarana Burke and Greta Thunberg. My research question is what kinds of interpretative repertoires are constructed in modern public media about female activists? Looking at the characteristics of language used in modern newspapers writing about Angela Davis, Malala Yousafzai, Tana Burke, Narges Mohammadi, Rosa Parks, and Greta Thunberg I would like my paper to investigate this issue. We are required to use Nexis database for this qualitative project. There are some parts of this research project that I already had to submit for tutor marked assignemt. I had to write a part of the literature review, and project proposal and ethical aproval. I still need to write the poster and abstract ( that is due on the 17th April, which also I don\'t know how to do since I only have the idea for my project).

A decade of transformation and value implications,Thesis,25000,100,APA,25,15,"Strategic evolution and intrinsic valuation of SHELL. A decade of transformation and value implications Introduction When starting this work, where Shell company will be at the center of, I first of all carefully familiarized myself with the company\'s strategy. One, perhaps, key sentence of the strategy caught my attention: “Our Powering Progress strategy includes: creating value for shareholders, achieving zero emissions, energy for life and respect for nature. Our goal is to contribute to progress together...\"" If the creation of value for shareholders, the production of the company\'s main products (oil, gas or energy) with respect for nature are the goals that apparently remain unchanged for the company throughout its 117 years of existence, then one element of this formula of strategic goals is the achievement of zero emissions is certainly something that attracts special attention, as it indicates a sharp turn in the history of the company. And this is not just a reversal, but the basis for a deep transformation that can fundamentally change the essence of the company and, most importantly in our case, its market value. It was this feature of the moment that convinced me to choose the Shell company for further analysis. Statement of problem In the coming years, this company will undergo radical changes at all levels of its activity. And therefore, the task of projecting its cash flows in conditions of constant changes, calculating its intrinsic value, becomes quite a challenge. This is indeed not easy, as the world is in a dynamic process of finding ways to benefit from energy while radically reducing emissions. This requires the development and use of energy solutions with low and zero carbon emissions. As a result, technologies will be deployed to achieve this goal. Shell has always been technological in its field, from the first oil discoveries to deep-sea exploration. Today, Shell faces even bigger challenges: the company, which is one of the world\'s leading energy suppliers, will without a doubt play one of the key roles in the energy transition, as climate change is one of the biggest problems facing the world today. Shell also defined its goals for reducing the net carbon intensity of the energy products that the company sells. The year 2016 was taken as the starting point. In stages, this goal looked like this: a reduction of 6-8% by the end of 2023, a reduction of 9-12% by the end of 2024 and a reduction of 9-13% by the end of 2025. \""Our medium and long-term goals are to reduce by 20% by 2030, 45% by 2035 and 100% by 2050.\"" (Company strategy). This means that the company must transform its business every year by producing and selling more low-carbon products and services, such as electricity generated by solar and wind energy, hydrogen, biofuels and electric vehicle charging. The company must supply more and more products that will help various sectors of the economy to decarbonize. And this, in turn, means that the task of evaluating the company should include an in-depth assessment of possible investment decisions that will have a direct impact on the company\'s activities and, accordingly, will have a direct impact on a number of financial statement items. Thus, my thesis will aim to determine the intrinsic value of Shell in view of the growing market challenges. Research questions The purpose of my work can be summarized in the search for answers to the following questions: Main question What is the intrinsic value of Shell, considering its strategic positioning and financial performance? Sub-questions: What are the core business activities, organizational structure, and historical background of Company Shell? What is the current strategic situation of Shell, and how has it evolved over the past 10 years? What are the key financial indicators and performance metrics of Shel over the past 5 years? How do the identified strategic factors align with the financial performance of Shell, and what are the key drivers influencing its forecasted financial performance?",,,,,No,,,,,,,,1595,239.25,1355.75,,82.72.14.33,"Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 17_4 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) CriOS/123.0.6312.52 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1",06/04/2024 10:30,0000-00-00 00:00:00

At least two case studies. Assignment guidelines: It is an academic assignment, NOT a descriptive one, not meant to be a description of what happened on placement. It\'s about what the literature says, your narrative about a case/incident involving a service user which you observed in practice. Organise your narrative into themes and use the themes to guide your literature search, so that you can create academic paragraphs that follow on from each other and relate directly to the literature. Let your narrative be in line with the literature and give a structure to the essay. Don\'t spend lots of time describing things without aligning it to the literature, you are expected to create an academic discussion. * Don\'t use websites when searching for references that relate to your essay, focus on high-quality primary sources of information from recognised academic texts and journals. Ensure the assignment is academic and supplemented with other sources, especially national policies, NICE guidelines, or local organisation guidelines. This is about making a contentious issue to create an academic argument, so you can demonstrate your knowledge of what\'s in the published literature, to arrive at an academic conclusion.
Don\'t mention names of organisations (Local Mental Health Trust can be used instead) or individuals (confidentiality/use of pseudonym) in line with NMC guidelines on confidentiality.
Use person-centred language, refrain from describing a patient as schizophrenic but use appropriate words such as \'person suffering from schizophrenia\'. The patient must be anonymous!
Discuss your observation of the clinicians\' clinical skills and tools that were used to assess these problems and how these were managed through care pathways, relating theory to practice by reflecting on their clinical practice. * Discuss your observation of their mental health problem and the impact on service users, carers, self, and other professionals. * Discuss factors that may prevent the recognition and identification of mental health problems. * Discuss factors responsible for the non-recognition and detection of these mental health problems (e.g. in people with a learning disability) will be explored and the impact this may have on service users, carers, and health professionals. * Demonstrate your knowledge of the NICE guidelines around the mental health problem being discussed. * Discuss the problem of excessive reliance on medications where optimised psychotherapy and social needs intervention may have also been beneficial. Explore national and NICE guidelines around psychotherapy and social needs interventions for mental health patients. * Demonstrate in your conclusion part how this literature will influence your continuing professional development. Remember that you must show evidence that you have read the literature and understand how this applies to what you are describing (the narrative). Group your narrative into themes and points to guide your literature search. Focus on high-quality, primary sources of information from recognised academic texts and journals. You can supplement these with other sources of information, especially policies and guidelines.

Asking you to gather wider external data would present too big a task to undertake in the time-frame, plus it is also used for non-UK students on the module and/or course who don\'t have the same access to wider material. That\'s supported by theory, which can come from Hooley, Kotler and any other textbooks / journals you choose to utilise. The aim is that you analyse the case using theory, coming to conclusions. You then present your recommendations, supported by both theory and your analysis. Some relevant noteworthy theories are; the product life cycle - Hooley (2020) pg 76 and porters 5 forces - hooley (2020) pg 72, brand identity prism - kapferer (2012) pg149.
