                        <p>This type of scenario is highly unlikely. Even if such a case occurs where the expert is not available to help you and you have paid for the assignment in full; you are highly encouraged to order any other assignment order of equivalent cost.</p>
                        <h4>Cancellation from the customerâ€™s side- Orders can only cancelled within the 24 hours only:</h4>
                        <p>If you have placed your order earlier and have changed your mind later, the order can be cancelled only within the next 24 hours of order placement. If the writer has started working on it, you will have to continue with it. In the cases of order cancellation within the mentioned time, you can request a full refund or store credits. You can also order any other type of assignment of the same worth, right away.</p>
                        <h4>Not getting a desired grade- We guarantee quality, not a specific grade:</h4>
                        <p>If you are aiming to get an A plus in your paper and expect us to guarantee that then it is not possible. At Assignment Ace, we guarantee to provide you with a high-quality paper with perfect formatting, grammar, and structure, but we certainly cannot guarantee a specific grade as it totally depends on the studentâ€™s overall performance throughout the semester/term.</p>
